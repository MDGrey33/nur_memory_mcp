Subject: Urgent: Database Connection Pooling
Date: 2024-03-20

David, Emma,

I've completed my review of the database connection strategy. Here are my findings:

Current State:
- Max connections: 20 (will bottleneck at 500+ concurrent users)
- No connection pooling configured
- Third-party payment API SLA concern remains (99.5% may not suffice)

My Decision:
We need to implement PgBouncer before launch. Emma, please add this to
the infrastructure work alongside auto-scaling.

Timeline:
- David: Continue caching layer (due March 22nd) - on track
- Emma: Add PgBouncer to auto-scaling work (due March 23rd)

Risk Mitigation:
I'm escalating the payment API SLA concern to Alice. We may need a fallback
payment processor for launch week.

Let's discuss implementation details in tomorrow's standup.

Bob Smith
Engineering Lead
