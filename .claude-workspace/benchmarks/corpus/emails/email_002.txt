Subject: Budget Revision - Q2 Planning
Date: 2024-03-23

James,

Per your decision in Friday's executive review, I've prepared the revised budget
projections reflecting the 15% reduction in non-essential spending.

Key changes effective April 1st:
- Travel budget: reduced from $50K to $35K
- Conference attendance: paused until Q3
- Contractor budgets: reduced by 20%

Hiring Impact:
- 3 open positions paused (marketing, sales, ops)
- 2 critical engineering roles remain open (per your approval)

Runway Analysis:
- Current runway: 14 months (if growth targets missed)
- Post-cuts runway: 18 months

I recommend we revisit hiring plans after Q2 board meeting, as discussed.

The Grace's marketing team has requested $5,000 additional for influencer outreach.
I'll need your approval before releasing those funds.

Best regards,
Karen Liu
CFO
