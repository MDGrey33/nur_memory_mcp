Team,

Following yesterday's planning meeting, I want to confirm the updated timeline:

- API refactor deadline: March 25th (Bob leading)
- UI mockups: March 20th (Carol delivering)
- Launch date: April 1st (confirmed)

Bob, please let me know if you need additional resources for the refactor.
The infrastructure team has approved the budget for scaling up.

Important: David's caching work takes priority over new features until March 22nd.
This was decided in today's engineering sync.

Let's sync again on Friday to review progress.

Best,
Alice Chen
Product Manager
