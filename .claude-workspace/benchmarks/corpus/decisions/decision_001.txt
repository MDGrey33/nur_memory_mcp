Decision Record: Mobile App Home Screen Design
Date: 2024-03-20
Decision Maker: Alice Chen (PM), with input from Carol Davis, Frank Lee
Status: Approved

## Context

The mobile app requires a home screen redesign to improve user engagement.
Carol presented three design options based on user research.

## Options Considered

1. **Option A: Card-based layout** - Quick actions, visual clarity
2. **Option B: List view** - Expandable sections, compact
3. **Option C: Tab-based navigation** - Dashboard-centric

## Decision

**Selected: Option A (Card-based layout)**

Rationale:
- User research showed 73% preference for card layout
- One-tap access to common tasks scored highest in usability testing
- Visual clarity aligns with brand guidelines

## Modifications

- Added notification badge to main action button (Alice's request)
- Badge requires backend changes for unread count tracking (Frank noted)

## Timeline Impact

Frank estimates 2 extra weeks needed for navigation stack refactoring.
Alice to discuss timeline adjustment with stakeholders on March 22nd.

## Action Items

- Carol: Updated mockups with badge by March 22nd
- Frank: Detailed timeline breakdown by March 21st EOD
