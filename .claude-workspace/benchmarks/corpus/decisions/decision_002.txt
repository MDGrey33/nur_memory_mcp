Decision Record: Pricing Model Selection
Date: 2024-03-15
Decision Maker: Alice Chen (PM)
Stakeholders: Bob Smith (Eng Lead), Carol Davis (Design)
Status: Approved

## Context

The team needed to finalize pricing strategy before April 1st launch.
Multiple models were evaluated based on market research and cost analysis.

## Options Considered

1. **Freemium Model** - Free tier with paid upgrades
2. **Subscription Only** - Monthly/annual plans
3. **Usage-Based** - Pay per API call/storage

## Decision

**Selected: Freemium Model**

Rationale:
- Lowers barrier to entry for new users
- Proven conversion funnel in our market segment
- Aligns with competitor landscape

## Concerns Raised

Bob raised infrastructure cost concerns:
- Free tier users will consume resources without revenue
- Need careful monitoring of usage patterns

Resolution:
- Alice confirmed budget approval for additional infrastructure
- Rate limiting implemented for free tier
- Upgrade prompts triggered at usage thresholds

## Financial Impact

- Expected 5% free-to-paid conversion in first 6 months
- Infrastructure cost increase of $2,000/month for free tier
- Break-even point: 500 paid subscribers

## Dependencies

- Pricing page design (Carol) - delivered March 18th
- Billing integration (Bob's team) - due March 25th
