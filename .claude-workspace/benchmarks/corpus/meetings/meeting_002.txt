Subject: Engineering Sync - API Performance
Date: 2024-03-18
Attendees: Bob Smith (Eng Lead), David Park (Backend), Emma Wilson (DevOps)

## Status Updates

David reported the new caching layer is 80% complete. Performance tests show
3x improvement in response times.

Emma flagged a concern: our current infrastructure might not handle the expected
load during launch week. She estimates we need to scale up to 5 nodes minimum.

## Decisions

Bob decided to prioritize the caching work over new features. David will focus
exclusively on this until March 22nd.

The team agreed to implement auto-scaling before launch. Emma will configure
this by March 23rd.

## Risks Identified

- Database connection pooling may become a bottleneck
- Third-party payment API has 99.5% SLA, which may not be sufficient

## Action Items

- David: Complete caching layer by March 22nd
- Emma: Set up auto-scaling and load testing by March 23rd
- Bob: Review database connection strategy by March 20th
