Subject: Design Review - Mobile App Redesign
Date: 2024-03-20
Attendees: Carol Davis (Design), Frank Lee (Mobile Lead), Alice Chen (PM)

## Review Summary

Carol presented three design options for the mobile app home screen:
- Option A: Card-based layout with quick actions
- Option B: List view with expandable sections
- Option C: Tab-based navigation with dashboard

After user research feedback, the team decided to go with Option A. Users
preferred the visual clarity and one-tap access to common tasks.

## Feedback

Alice requested adding a notification badge to the main action button.
Frank noted this would require backend changes to track unread counts.

Carol agreed to update the designs by March 22nd to include the badge.

## Concerns Raised

Frank is worried about the timeline. The new design requires significant
refactoring of the navigation stack. He estimates 2 extra weeks needed.

Alice asked Frank to provide a detailed breakdown by EOD tomorrow so she
can discuss timeline adjustments with stakeholders.

## Next Steps

- Carol: Deliver updated mockups with notification badge by March 22nd
- Frank: Send timeline breakdown by March 21st EOD
- Alice: Schedule stakeholder call for March 22nd afternoon
