Attendees: Alice Chen (PM), Bob Smith (Eng Lead), Carol Davis (Design)

## Discussion

Alice presented the Q1 roadmap. Key points:

1. **Launch Date**: After discussion, Alice decided we will launch on April 1st.
   This gives us 2 weeks buffer before the conference.

2. **Pricing**: The team agreed to go with a freemium model. Bob raised concerns
   about infrastructure costs, but Alice confirmed budget approval.

## Action Items
