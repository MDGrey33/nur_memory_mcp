Caching layer is done! :tada: Performance tests show 3.2x improvement in response times.
Ready for review @bob.smith

[10:18 AM] bob.smith:
Nice work David! That's even better than the 3x we projected.
I'll review the PR this afternoon.

[10:22 AM] emma.wilson:
Great timing. I just finished setting up the auto-scaling config.
We can now handle 5x current load automatically.

[10:25 AM] bob.smith:
Perfect. @emma.wilson did you add PgBouncer as I requested yesterday?

[10:28 AM] emma.wilson:
Yes, PgBouncer is configured. Connection pool set to 100.
Should handle 2000+ concurrent users now.

[10:30 AM] david.park:
Should I start on the payment fallback integration? Still worried about that 99.5% SLA.

[10:35 AM] bob.smith:
Hold off on that. Alice is checking with the payment provider about SLA guarantees.
Focus on helping Emma with load testing instead.

[10:37 AM] alice.chen:
Update: Payment provider confirmed they can offer 99.9% SLA for enterprise tier.
Cost is $500/month extra. @bob.smith worth it?

[10:40 AM] bob.smith:
Definitely worth it for launch week peace of mind. Let's do it.

[10:42 AM] alice.chen:
Done. I'll get the contract signed today. Crisis averted! :rocket:
