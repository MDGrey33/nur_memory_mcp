    "prompt": "Question: When was the Marines Advanced Base Force formed?\n\nContexts: [411845#1] 63rd (Royal Naval) Division - When the war began, a Marine Brigade of four infantry battalions was formed from men of the Royal Marine Light Infantry and Royal Marine Artillery. The brigade was to be an Advanced Base Force, according to a pre-war plan to furnish the Admiralty with a means to take, fortify or defend temporary naval bases for fleet operations or the supply of army field forces. The recruits included regular marines and those mobilised from the Fleet Reserve; each battalion was drawn from one of the big naval depot ports—Chatham, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Deal—and named accordingly.\n[6282905#2] 3rd Low Altitude Air Defense Battalion - The United States Marine Corps has a long history of seizing and defending advance bases. Prior to World War I, base defense was the Marine Corps’ primary mission. During World War I, the Advance Base Force was created to seize and defend enemy territory consisting primarily of bases. In 1933, the Advance Base Force transformed into the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) under Commandant Major General Ben Fuller. By 1939, the looming threat of Japanese aggression in the Pacific solidified the need for advance base defense in the region. Commandant Major General Thomas Holcomb formed four Defense Battalions to defend advance naval bases from ground and air attack. The core of the original battalions was formed from two infantry battalions, 1st and 2nd Battalion, 15th Marine Regiment. Subsequent Defense Battalions were formed with air defense personnel and artillerymen; infantrymen were attached as required. The first Defense Battalions included nearly 900 Marines divided into three anti-aircraft batteries, three seacoast batteries, and ground and anti-aircraft machine gun batteries. Follow-on evolutions included more sophisticated artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and search radars. These Defense Battalions provided the first combined arms teams and proved to be a very effective fighting force.\n[19125193#35] Advanced Base Force - The Marine Corps's Advanced Base Force, and its Navy cooperatives, participated in the United States's next intervention when the late-President of Mexico Francisco Madero was executed by Victoriano Huerta's Porfirista military conspirators on 22 February 1913. 500 Marines of the 2nd Advanced Base Regiment were among the first to land at Veracruz, Mexico in April 1914 after the Tampico Affair. The aviation company with the Advanced Base Force, however, missed its first chance at expeditionary duty during this operation because it had not yet discovered a way to get its two aircraft, both seaplanes, to the objective area in flying condition.\n[6151146#82] History of the United States Marine Corps - The successful landing at Guantanamo and the readiness of the Marines for the Spanish–American War were in contrast to the slow mobilization of the United States Army in the war. In 1900, the General Board of the United States Navy decided to give the Marine Corps primary responsibility for the seizure and defense of advanced naval bases. The Marine Corps formed an expeditionary battalion to be permanently based in the Caribbean, which subsequently practiced landings in 1902 in preparation for a war with Germany over their siege in Venezuela. Under Major Lejeune, in early 1903, it also undertook landing exercises with the Army in Maine, and in November, blocked Colombian Army forces sent to quash a Panamanian rebellion, an action which led to the independence of Panama. Marines stayed in Panama, with brief intermissions as they were deployed for other actions, until 1914. From 1903 to 1904, 25 Marines protected American diplomats in Abyssinia, modern day Ethiopia. A small group of Marines made a show of force in Tangier to resolve the kidnapping of Ion Perdicaris in the summer of 1904. The Marine Corps Advanced Base School was founded as was the Advanced Base Force, the prototype of the Fleet Marine Force.\n[19125193#17] Advanced Base Force - The first advanced base exercises had taken place on Culebra, Puerto Rico in 1903, proving to the General Board how well the Marines could perform the ideals and concepts that were conceived. It opened many new perspectives for the future of the Marines; and it sparked a harsh chapter of interservice rivalry. The captain of USS \"Panther\" demanded that the Marines perform their duties as a ship's guard, including ship security and acting as a provost marshal to provide deterrence against mutiny. This act forcibly neglected the advanced base force battalion's training schedule and defense planning. Even ashore the naval officers had little understanding of the problems of moving heavy weaponry and equipment across broken terrain, and the advanced base force languished by 1903 due to the large number of east coast Marines deployed to Panama and Cuba. Only then were the Marines in the Philippines included in the General Board's advanced base force concept.\n[4498914#1] 8th Marine Regiment (United States) - The regiment comprises three infantry battalions and one headquarters company:The 8th Marine Regiment was formed on 9 October 1917, at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia during the buildup for World War I. While training for war, the command was transferred to Fort Crockett, Texas, to guard the nearby Mexican oil fields. The regiment was joined there by the 9th Marines to form the 3d Marine Brigade; the first Advance Base Force of World War I. As such, the Marines were held in reserve to establish and defend naval bases in the Atlantic Ocean or the West Indies, if required. The 8th Marines was inactivated at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 25 April 1919.\n[19125193#10] Advanced Base Force - On 3 January 1914, the Fixed Defense Regiment at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico, along with the Mobile Defense Force, formed the Advanced Base Force Brigade, under the command of Colonel George Barnett, who had commanded the Marine Barracks at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and the Advanced Base School. By 18 February 1914, it was redesignated as the 1st Regiment, Advanced Base Brigade. For the next two months, the regiment operated onboard ship off New Orleans and Algiers, Louisiana.\n[19125193#23] Advanced Base Force - Two new revolutions in the Marine Corps also helped established the legitimacy of the Advanced Base Force; the first was the formation of the Marine Corps Association (MCA) and the \"Marine Corps Gazette\", founded by John A. Lejeune in 1911, and second, the new avenues for innovation of Marine and Naval Aviation. The Marine Corps' first aviator, 1st Lieutenant Alfred A. Cunningham, saw a role for aircraft in the advanced base force. Joined at Annapolis by Lieutenant Bernard L. Smith, the Marine Corps' second aviator, both learned to fly planes from civilian instructors, and both later reported to the Advanced Base Force in 1913, to create an aviation section within the force.\n[19125193#0] Advanced Base Force - The United States Marine Corps's Advanced Base Force (Advance Base Force in some references) was a coastal and naval base defense force that was designed to set up mobile and fixed bases in the event of major landing operations within, and beyond, the territorial United States. Established in the beginning of the 20th century, the Advanced Base Force was the United States' first combined task force built on the concept of the Marine Corps' traditional role in expeditionary warfare. The slow development of the advanced base force played a significant role in the controversy over the removal of the ships' guards (Marines on Navy ships) in 1908–1909.\n[19125193#7] Advanced Base Force - The Advanced Base Force was \"officially\" created on 23 December 1913 by Commandant William P. Biddle and was designated as the 1st Advanced Base Brigade, the lineal forebearer of the 1st Marine Division. Briefly, two regiments were designated as the Fixed Defense Regiment and the Mobile Defense Regiment. They both are forebears of Marine regiments that exist today; the 1st Regiment of the Advanced Base Force subsequently became the 2nd Marine Regiment, whereas the 2nd Regiment became the 1st Marine Regiment.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

Goldrick established the Union School, Denver's first school, a private school that served thirteen students. Other private schools opened shortly thereafter to accommodate Denver's rapidly growing population during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. In 1861, the new territorial government established Goldrick as the superintendent in Arapahoe County (which then encompassed Denver). Soon after the first two public school districts in Denver were formed: District One on the east side of the city and District Two on the west side. District Two opened the first public school in Denver on December 1, 1862 in a rented log cabin and District One followed suit soon after. On April 2, 1873 the first purpose built school building, the \"Arapahoe School\", opened.\n[9083795#1] History of education in the United States - The first American schools in the thirteen original colonies opened in the 17th century. Boston Latin School was founded in 1635 and is both the first public school and oldest existing school in the United States. The first free taxpayer-supported public school in North America, the Mather School, was opened in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1639. Cremin (1970) stresses that colonists tried at first to educate by the traditional English methods of family, church, community, and apprenticeship, with schools later becoming the key agent in \"socialization.\" At first, the rudiments of literacy and arithmetic were taught inside the family, assuming the parents had those skills. Literacy rates were much higher in New England because much of the population had been deeply involved in the Protestant Reformation and learned to read in order to read the Scriptures. Literacy was much lower in the South, where the Anglican Church was the established church. Single working-class people formed a large part of the population in the early years, arriving as indentured servants. The planter class did not support public education but arranged for private tutors for their children, and sent some to England at appropriate ages for further education.\n[5660945#41] Fourth Ward, Houston - The Freedmen's Bureau opened schools for children in the area after the establishment of Freedmen's Town. The Texas Legislature authorized the creation of public schools for Freedmen's Town by 1870. By 1872 most of the students and teachers who were at the bureau schools, which were closing, left them to attend the state-managed Gregory Institute, named after Edgar M. Gregory, an officer in the Union army in the U.S. Civil War and the assistant commissioner of the Texas area's Freedmen's Bureau. The school, which first opened in 1872, was the first school for freed slaves in Houston. Mike Snyder of the \"Houston Chronicle\" said that it was \"perhaps\" the first school for freed slaves in the State of Texas. By 1876 the school became a part of the Houston public school system. The Edgar M. Gregory School, a elementary school, opened in 1926. It was vacant from 1980 until its re-purposing as a library. When it was vacant, it had broken windows, a leaky roof that allowed rain to pour into the facility, and pigeons living in the facility. In 2009 the facility was re-purposed as a research library.\n[53825825#1] Boston Renaissance Charter Public School - The school first opened in 1995; the State of Massachusetts allowed the formation of charter schools in 1993. It was co-founded by several area figures, including the former Horace Mann Foundation executive director, Dr. Robert Gaudet. Its initial location was in Downtown Boston. Edison Schools (now EdisonLearning) operated the school by contract. In its first year it had 637 students in elementary grades. The school administration hoped to have the student body increase up to 1,265 students. Edison Schools hoped to establish a model school so that it could repeat this model in other parts of the U.S. The school administration envisioned that the school would cover grades Kindergarten through 12.\n[556655#21] Bankstown - In 1862, the Church of England School was first opened and was commissioned as a public school in 1867. Bankstown's first public school was built where McLeod Reserve is currently situated in 1880. In 1882 49 boys and 36 girls were enrolled, and upkeep expenses totalled 219 pounds, eight shillings and 11 pence. The school's first headmaster was Dugald McLeod who taught at the school since its opening until 1912. The site of the well used by Bankstown Public School is today commemorated by a plaque. The school was demolished in 1924 due to the development of North Bankstown School in the same year. The current Bankstown Public School, located in Restwell Street Central Bankstown, opened in 1915. It recently celebrated its centenary (1915-2015). Since then Bankstown has seen the development of several different educational facilities, such as, Al Amanah College, Bankstown Senior College (formerly Bankstown Boys High School 1963-1991), Bankstown Girls High School, Georges River Grammar School, LaSalle Catholic College and St Euphemia College. Tertiary institutions located in the suburb include TAFE Bankstown and University of Western Sydney, Bankstown Campus.\n[3442188#5] Indianapolis Public Schools - From 1864 to 1916, three high schools opened under the school district. The first was Indianapolis high School (later renamed Shortridge High School in 1885) in 1864, as the city's first public high school. The school opened in the Marion County Seminary Building, although it was later moved to its present location. The second school was Manual Training High School, later to be known as Emmerich Manual High School, and it was opened in 1895. In 1916, Arsenal Technical Schools, which had opened four years earlier on the grounds of a former U.S. Civil War Arsenal, was incorporated into Indianapolis Public Schools and became Arsenal Technical High School.\n[12227763#9] Baden, St. Louis - The first public school, opened in 1872, was a one-room building at Christian and Switzer Avenue. Before 1872 the students in Baden attended a school in rural Missouri. In 1878 the Board of Education purchased a brick building at Church Road and Bittner Ave., a three-story building with six rooms accommodating 240 students. At that time the first public school one room building was opened for African American students, which was initially named Colored School #11 and later renamed Aldridge School. In 1900 this school became inadequate and portable units were erected in its yard. In 1904 a kindergarten class was opened up in the portable building. In 1906 another portable building was open at Halls Ferry and Gimblin. The present Baden School at 8724 Halls Ferry Road, opened in 1908, is now closed.\n[872452#4] Seattle Public Schools - In 1867, the public school moved to what was then the County Building on Third Avenue between James and Jefferson, the site of today's Prefontaine Fountain. A year later, the school moved to Yesler's Pavilion (later Yesler's Hall) at present-day First and Cherry. A year later the school moved again to a temporary building (called Bacon's Hall after its first teacher, Carrie Bacon) located at the site of the present King County Court House. In 1870 the first \"permanent\" school building, the Central School, opened on Third Avenue between Madison and Spring Streets. It originally had two classrooms; a third was built in its attic in 1881.\nMeanwhile, in 1873 the two-room North School opened at Third and Pine, and in 1875 the school district had purchased at 6th and Madison, where the Sixth Street School, also known as Eastern School, opened promptly in a temporary building and grew into successively larger and better-built buildings in 1877 and 1883. The latter, an \"elegant wooden building\" with an imposing \"French mansard roof, clock tower, and tall central belfry\" superseded the old Central School as well as the North School. From 1884, it was known as the Central School. Classes extended through 12th grade, and the first class graduated from 12th grade in 1886. However the school burned in 1888.\n[31477662#2] 7th Arizona Territorial Legislature - Following the establishment of a public school system by the previous legislature, Arizona's first public school had opened in March 1872. On a more private level, Governor Safford and his wife Jenny had experienced a public falling out of their marriage following the death of their infant son. The situation had escalated to the point where she had printed and distributed pamphlets claiming he had committed marital infidelity and contracted a venereal disease.\n[3837838#5] Thomasites - Although the Thomasites were the largest group of pioneers with the purpose of educating the Filipinos, they were not the first to be deployed by Washington, D.C. A few weeks before the arrival of USS \"Thomas\", U.S. Army soldiers had already begun teaching Filipinos the English language, thus in effect laying the foundation of the Philippine public school system. The U.S. Army opened the Philippines' first public school in Corregidor Island, after Admiral George Dewey vanquished the Spanish Pacific fleet in Manila Bay on May 1, 1898. Also, a few weeks before the arrival of USS \"Thomas\", another group composed of 48 American teachers also arrived in the Philippines, aboard the \"USAT Sheridan\".\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

Two years later, the program had over 30 registered students. The school was expanded over the next two decades under the leadership of Frederick Giesecke and Goldwin Goldsmith. In 1925, the school became the first in Texas to be accepted for membership in the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture. The program was accredited in 1935 by the National Architectural Accreditation Board. The school moved into its permanent home in the Architecture Building (Goldsmith Hall, named after Goldwin Goldsmith) in 1933 and became the School of Architecture in 1948. The school's first graduate was Bertram Ernst Giesecke, who was officially licensed as an architect in 1927.UTSOA is home to:\n[4283006#8] Cockrell School of Engineering - Joe H. Gill and his engineering friends thoughtfully considered how to make a holiday of April Fool's Day. After an unsuccessful attempt involving tying cans around dogs' tails and releasing them to disrupt class, the group of students saw a wooden statue about five feet high while getting refreshments, which they requested to borrow. The next day, Gill presented the statue as their patron saint and traced his ancestry back to ancient times between classes. The presentation successfully broke up classes, and led to his christening as Alexander Frederick Claire, patron saint of UT engineers, exactly one year later. Alec was at the center of a friendly rivalry between law and engineering students for many years, and was subject to numerous escapades such as kidnappings and amputations. Today, what is left of the original wooden statue is safely preserved in the engineering library.\n[46937553#4] Gregory L.

    "prompt": "Question: What unit is used to measure mass?\n\nContexts: [45332843#3] Peruvian units of measurement - Several units were used to measure mass. One libra was equal to 0.460 09 kg. Some other units are given below:\n[45013949#4] Cuban units of measurement - A Number of units were used to measure mass. Some of units which were used in 1920s too in addition to metric system, and which belonged to old Spanish, American, and local, are provided below:\n[19048#10] Mass - The force known as \"weight\" is proportional to mass and acceleration in all situations where the mass is accelerated away from free fall. For example, when a body is at rest in a gravitational field (rather than in free fall), it must be accelerated by a force from a scale or the surface of a planetary body such as the Earth or the Moon. This force keeps the object from going into free fall. Weight is the opposing force in such circumstances, and is thus determined by the acceleration of free fall. On the surface of the Earth, for example, an object with a mass of 50 kilograms weighs 491 newtons, which means that 491 newtons is being applied to keep the object from going into free fall. By contrast, on the surface of the Moon, the same object still has a mass of 50 kilograms but weighs only 81.5 newtons, because only 81.5 newtons is required to keep this object from going into a free fall on the moon. Restated in mathematical terms, on the surface of the Earth, the weight \"W\" of an object is related to its mass \"m\" by , where is the acceleration due to Earth's gravitational field, (expressed as the acceleration experienced by a free-falling object).\n[19048#1] Mass - The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). In physics, mass is not the same as weight, even though mass is often determined by measuring the object's weight using a spring scale, rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses. An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the lower gravity, but it would still have the same mass. This is because weight is a force, while mass is the property that (along with gravity) determines the strength of this force.\n[45087864#8] Eritrean units of measurement - Several units were used to measure mass. These units are vary from one province or city to another and these units are local units. One messé was equal to 1.50 l. Some other units are given below:\n1 cabaho = 4 messé\n[15492#6] Imperial units - These measurements were in use from 1826, when the new imperial gallon was defined, but were officially abolished in the United Kingdom on 1 January 1971. In the USA, though no longer recommended, the apothecaries' system is still used occasionally in medicine, especially in prescriptions for older medications.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the UK used three different systems for mass and weight. The distinction between mass and weight is not always clearly drawn. Strictly a pound is a unit of mass, although it is commonly referred to as a weight. When a distinction is necessary, the term \"pound-force\" may be used to refer to a unit of force rather than mass. The troy pound () was made the primary unit of mass by the 1824 Act; however, its use was abolished in the UK on 1 January 1879, with only the troy ounce () and its decimal subdivisions retained. The \"Weights and Measures Act 1855\" (18 & 19 Victoria C72) made the avoirdupois pound the primary unit of mass. In all the systems, the fundamental unit is the pound, and all other units are defined as fractions or multiples of it.\n[172987#6] Solar mass - As a unit of measurement, the solar mass came into use before the AU and the gravitational constant were precisely measured. This is because the relative mass of another planet in the Solar System or the combined mass of two binary stars can be calculated in units of Solar mass directly from the orbital radius and orbital period of the planet or stars using Kepler's third law, provided that orbital radius is measured in astronomical units and orbital period is measured in years.\n[45087864#5] Eritrean units of measurement - Several units were used to measure mass. These units are vary from one province or city to another and these units are local units. One rotolo (pound) was equal to 0.448 g. Some other units are given below:\n[45150945#9] Icelandic units of measurement - A number of units were used to measure mass. One pund was equal to 0.5 kg as it was defined by its metric equivalent. Some other units are given below:\n[14476384#7] Mass versus weight - Because mass and weight are separate quantities, they have different units of measure. In the International System of Units (SI), the kilogram is the basic unit of mass, and the newton is the basic unit of force. The non-SI kilogram-force is also a unit of force typically used in the measure of weight. Similarly, the avoirdupois pound, used in both the Imperial system and U.S. customary units, is a unit of mass, and its related unit of force is the pound-force.\n[7158#0] Carat (mass) - The carat (ct) (not to be confused with the karat, sometimes spelled carat, a unit of purity of gold alloys), is a unit of mass equal to 200 mg (0.2 g; 0.007055 oz) and is used for measuring gemstones and pearls.\nThe current definition, sometimes known as the metric carat, was adopted in 1907 at the Fourth General Conference on Weights and Measures, and soon afterwards in many countries around the world. The carat is divisible into one hundred \"points\" of two milligrams each. Other subdivisions, and slightly different mass values, have been used in the past in different locations.\n[19048#9] Mass - In everyday usage, mass and \"weight\" are often used interchangeably. For instance, a person's weight may be stated as 75 kg. In a constant gravitational field, the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, and it is unproblematic to use the same unit for both concepts. But because of slight differences in the strength of the Earth's gravitational field at different places, the distinction becomes important for measurements with a precision better than a few percent, and for places far from the surface of the Earth, such as in space or on other planets. Conceptually, \"mass\" (measured in kilograms) refers to an intrinsic property of an object, whereas \"weight\" (measured in newtons) measures an object's resistance to deviating from its natural course of free fall, which can be influenced by the nearby gravitational field. No matter how strong the gravitational field, objects in free fall are weightless, though they still have mass.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Is the US a bicameral government?\n\nContexts: [204299#3] Bicameralism - The Founding Fathers of the United States favoured a bicameral legislature. The idea was to have the Senate be wealthier and wiser. Benjamin Rush saw this though, and noted that \"this type of dominion is almost always connected with opulence\". The Senate was created to be a stabilising force, elected not by mass electors, but selected by the State legislators. Senators would be more knowledgeable and more deliberate—a sort of republican nobility—and a counter to what Madison saw as the \"fickleness and passion\" that could absorb the House.\n[11756907#112] List of awards and nominations received by Michael Jackson - The [[United States Congress]] is the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] of the [[United States|United States of America]], consisting of two houses, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. They awarded [[The Jackson 5]] with a \"Special Commendation\" for positive [[role model]]s in 1972.\n[10890716#24] Member state of the European Union - The EU is divided between unicameral (single chamber) and bicameral (dual chamber) parliaments, with 15 unicameral national parliaments and 13 bicameral parliaments. The prime minister and government are usually directly accountable to the directly elected lower house and require its support to stay in office—the exception being Cyprus with its presidential system. Upper houses are composed differently in different member states: it can be directly elected like the Polish senate, indirectly elected, for example, by regional legislatures like the Federal Council of Austria, unelected, but representing certain interest groups like the National Council of Slovenia, unelected (though by and large appointed by elected officials) as a remnant of a non-democratic political system in earlier times (as in the House of Lords in the United Kingdom). Most (though not all) elections in the EU use some form of proportional representation. The most common type of proportional representation is the party-list system.\n[204299#22] Bicameralism - The European Union maintains a bicameral legislative system consisting of the European Parliament, which is elected in elections on the basis of universal suffrage, and the Council of the European Union, which consists of one representative for each Government of member countries, who are competent for a relevant field of legislation. The European Union is not considered a country nor a state, but it enjoys the power to address national Governments in many areas.\n[204299#16] Bicameralism - The bicameral Parliament of Australia consists of two Houses, the lower house is called the House of Representatives and the upper house is named the Senate. The lower house currently consists of 150 members, each elected from single member constituencies, known as electoral divisions (commonly referred to as \"electorates\" or \"seats\") using full-preference Instant-runoff voting. This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major parties, the Liberal/National Coalition and the Labor Party. The government of the day must achieve the confidence of this House to gain and hold power.\n[204299#18] Bicameralism - Unlike upper houses in most Westminster parliamentary systems, the Australian Senate is vested with significant power, including the capacity to block legislation initiated by the government in the House of Representatives, making it a distinctive hybrid of British Westminster bicameralism and US-style bicameralism. As a result of proportional representation, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. The governing party or coalition, which must maintain the confidence of the lower house, rarely has a majority in the Senate and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and Independents to get legislation passed.\n[31644#0] United States Constitution - The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States. The Constitution, originally comprising seven articles, delineates the national frame of government. Its first three articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress (Article One); the executive, consisting of the President (Article Two); and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts (Article Three). Articles Four, Five and Six embody concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the shared process of constitutional amendment. Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it. It is regarded as the oldest written and codified national constitution in force.\n[57169873#18] Privacy and the US government - The primary purpose of the legislative branch, also known as the United States Congress, is to pass legislation that is approved by both parts of its bicameral legislature. This bicameral system consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Congress performs several functions some of which include setting a budgetary policy and providing legislative oversight; however it has primarily impacted individual and entity privacy rights through the passing of privacy bills. The privacy tort passed by the United States Congress creates a Congressional timeline of privacy rights institutionalized through written word. Considering the word privacy itself only appeared in Congressional hearings post the 90th Congressional Committee, the conception of privacy rights in Congress was introduced relatively recently. This section looks at how the legislation passed by Congress and the regulatory agencies created by Congress form a clear timeline outlining the changing perspective of privacy rights relative to a changing technological world.\n[24425155#2] Comparison of U.S. state governments - Each state is itself a sovereign entity, and as such, reserves the right to organize in any way (within the above stated parameter) deemed appropriate by its people. As a result, while the governments of the various states share many similar features, they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance. No two state governments are identical. The following tables compare and contrast some of the features of U.S. state, and territorial governments, and also the government of the District of Columbia, its capital city.\nWith the exception of Nebraska, all American state legislatures are bicameral, meaning there is one legislative body separated into two units. Nebraska eliminated its lower house with a referendum during the 1936 elections. Also, some systems, such as New York's, have two legislative bodies while never technically referring to them in the state constitution as a single body. These dual systems are generally considered bicameral.\n[5670545#7] List of European Union member states by political system - While there had been legislatures with more than two chambers (tricameral and tetracameral ones), nowadays there are only unicameral and bicameral ones. Additionally, there are also differences in the degree of bicameralism. Whereas Italy is considered as having \"perfect bicameralism\", with both chambers being equal, most other bicameral systems restrict the upper house's powers to a certain extent. There is a slight trend towards unicameralism; some upper houses have seen their powers reduced or proposals to that end. Belgium's system has been reduced from a perfectly bicameral one to a nowadays \"de facto\" unicameral system. In 2009, Romania voted in favour of unicameralism, on a plebiscite, however the country still has a bicameral system, as of 2022. On the other hand, Ireland narrowly voted against abolishing their upper house in 2013, and Italy voted not to reduce its Senate's powers in 2016.\n[15775275#8] State governments of the United States - In 40 of the 49 bicameral state legislatures, the lower house is called the \"House of Representatives\". The name \"House of Delegates\" is used in Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. California and Wisconsin call their lower house the \"State Assembly\", while Nevada and New York simply call the lower house the \"Assembly\". New Jersey calls its lower house the \"General Assembly\".\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What's a visual novel?\n\nContexts: [587487#0] Visual novel - A is an interactive game genre, which originated in Japan, featuring text-based story with narrative style of literature and interactivity aided by static or sprite-based visuals, most often using anime-style art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels.\n[587487#2] Visual novel - Visual novels are often produced for video game consoles, and the more popular games have occasionally been ported to such systems. The more famous visual novels are also often adapted into the light novel, manga or anime formats. The market for visual novels outside of East Asia is small, though a number of anime based on visual novels are popular among anime fans in the Western world.\n[2494476#7] Nonlinear gameplay - Branching storylines are a common trend in visual novels, a subgenre of interactive narrative and adventure games. Visual novels frequently use multiple branching storylines to achieve multiple different endings, allowing non-linear freedom of choice along the way. Decision points within a visual novel often present players with the option of altering the course of events during the game, leading to many different possible outcomes. Visual novels are popular in East Asia, especially in Japan where they account for nearly 70% of personal computer games released there. A recent acclaimed example is \"\", where nearly every action and dialogue choice can lead to entirely new branching paths and endings. Each path only reveals certain aspects of the overall storyline and it is only after uncovering all the possible different paths and outcomes through multiple playthroughs that everything comes together to form a coherent well-written story.\n[587487#20] Visual novel - Many visual novels are centered on drama, particularly themes involving romance or family, but visual novels centered on science fiction, fantasy fiction, and horror fiction are not uncommon.\n[587487#9] Visual novel - The branching path stories found in visual novels represent an evolution of the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" concept. The digital medium allows for significant improvements, such as being able to fully explore multiple aspects and perspectives of a story. Another improvement is having hidden decision points that are automatically determined based on the player's past decisions. In \"Fate/stay night\", for example, the way the player character behaved towards non-player characters during the course of the game affects the way they react to the player character in later scenes, such as whether or not they choose to help in life-or-death situations. This would be far more difficult to track with physical books. More importantly, visual novels do not face the same length restrictions as a physical book. For example, the total word count of the English fan translation of \"Fate/stay night\", taking all the branching paths into account, exceeds that of \"The Lord of the Rings\". This significant increase in length allows visual novels to tell stories as long and complex as those often found in traditional novels, while still maintaining a branching path structure, and allowing them to focus on complex stories with mature themes and consistent plots in a way which \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books were unable to do due to their physical limitations. Visual novels with non-branching plots, such as \"Higurashi When They Cry\", \"\", \"Muv-Luv Alternative\", and \"\" are rare exceptions within the genre.\n[587487#4] Visual novel - Most visual novels have multiple storylines and more than one ending; the mechanic in these cases typically consists of intermittent multiple-choice decision points, where the player selects a direction in which to take the game. This style of gameplay is similar to story-driven interactive fiction, or the shorter and less detailed real-life gamebook books. Many fans of visual novels hold them up as exceptions to the relatively weak storytelling in video games overall.\n[587487#3] Visual novel - Visual novels are distinguished from other game types by their generally minimal gameplay. Typically the majority of player interaction is limited to clicking to keep the text, graphics and sound moving (many recent games offer \"play\" or \"fast-forward\" toggles that make this unnecessary), while making narrative choices along the way. Another main characteristic of visual novels are its strong emphasis on the prose, as the narration in visual novels are delivered through text. This characteristic makes playing visual novels similar to reading a book.\n[2538794#33] List of video game genres - A is a game featuring mostly static graphics, usually with anime-style art. As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels or tableau vivant stage plays. Many visual novels track statistics that the player must build in order to advance the plot, and permit a variety of endings, allowing more dynamic reactions to the player's actions than a typical linear adventure plot. Many visual novels are dating sims, including bishōjo games. Visual novels are especially prevalent in Japan, where they make up nearly 70% of PC games released. They are rarely produced for video game consoles, but the more popular games are sometimes ported to systems such as the Dreamcast or the PlayStation 2. The market for visual novels outside Japan, however, was nearly non-existent prior to the success of the Nintendo DS, for which several Japanese visual novels were released in the West, such as the \"Ace Attorney\" series.\n[36803227#1] Christine Love (writer) - Christine Love began creating visual novels while in school at Trent University. By January 2010, she had made a few small video games; written a novel and a few short stories, which she largely unsuccessfully tried to sell; and had made a visual novel each March for three consecutive years for NaNoRenO (National Ren'ai Game Writing Month), a month-long contest in the vein of National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) where developers attempt to create a visual novel in one month. In February 2010, she started a fourth visual novel, which resulted in \"\", her first game to receive widespread attention and acclaim. Set \"five minutes into the future of 1988\", \"Digital\" tells the story of the silent protagonist's online relationship with a girl named *Emilia, and a mystery surrounding the \"murders\" of several AI programs. The game is presented entirely through the interface of a 1980s computer with online bulletin board system posts and messages from other characters; the protagonist's own messages are implied but never shown. Love expected the game to reach as many people as her prior work, \"a dozen or so people\"; instead, the free game was noticed by video game publications and websites such as \"PC Gamer\" and Gamasutra and received much more attention, becoming what Love believes was \"a defining point in [her] writing career\". Widely praised by critics, \"Digital\" earned an honorable mention in Gamasutra's \"Best Indie Games of 2010\" list. Love felt that \"Digital\"s success turned her from a writer into an indie game developer.\n[587487#19] Visual novel - Up until the 1990s, the majority of visual novels utilized pixel art. This was particularly common on the NEC PC-9801 format, which showcased what is considered to be some of the best pixel art in the history of video games, with a popular example being \"Policenauts\" in 1994. There have also been visual novels that use live-action stills or video footage, such as several \"Sound Novel\" games by Chunsoft. The most successful example is \"Machi\", one of the most celebrated games in Japan, where it was voted No. 5 in a 2006 \"Famitsu\" reader poll of top 100 games of all time. The game resembled a live-action television drama, but allowing players to explore multiple character perspectives and affect the outcomes. Another successful example is \"\", which received a perfect score of 40 out of 40 from \"Famitsu\" magazine.\n[587487#1] Visual novel - In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels (abbreviated NVL, derived from \"novel\"), which consist predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG, or ADV derived from \"adventure\"), a form of adventure game which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as \"visual novels\" by international fans. Visual novels and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What highway connects from Texas to Canada?\n\nContexts: [1436627#14] Nuevo Laredo - Nuevo Laredo is on the primary trade route connecting Canada, the United States and Mexico. Both Nuevo Laredo and Laredo, Texas are now the gateway to Mexico's burgeoning industrial complex, offering diverse markets, business opportunities and profit potential, which both business and industry cannot find anywhere else. Nuevo Laredo is the only Mexico/U.S. border city strategically positioned at the convergence of all land transportation systems. The main highway and railroad leading from Central Mexico through Mexico City, San Luis Potosí, Saltillo and Monterrey join with two major U.S. rail lines at Nuevo Laredo and major American highway Interstate 35, thus offering fast access to the most important metropolitan areas and seaports of Texas, as well as northern states and Canada. For more than a decade, Mexico's economic policies have greatly increased Mexico/U.S. trade and cross-border production in the Nuevo Laredo area.\n[695351#0] U.S. Route 62 - U.S. Route 62 or U.S. Highway 62 (US 62) runs from the Mexico-US border at El Paso, Texas, to Niagara Falls, New York, near the Canada–US border. It is the only east-west United States Numbered Highway that connects Mexico and Canada.\n[7636116#3] Southern Manitoba - Southern Manitoba's central location in North America makes it a key part of the Mid Continent Trade & Transportation Corridor, connecting to a market of 100 million people. Both the Trans Canada Highway and the Yellowhead Highway provide key east-west traffic corridors from southern Manitoba to the neighboring provinces of Saskatchewan and Ontario. Provincial Highways 75 and 59 lead one hour south from Winnipeg to link with the U.S. National Highway System via North Dakota and Minnesota, providing key access to the Mid Continent Trade & Transportation Corridor centered on US Interstate highways I-29 and I-35, which connects Canada to a central North American market of 100 million people. Goods can be shipped by truck and rail from Canada through southern Manitoba to Mexico and all points between. The border crossing at Emerson processes over $15 billion in trade traffic annually (2013), more than any other border crossing in Western Canada, and 5th largest in Canada. An estimated 400,000 commercial trucks crossed the border through Emerson in 2013 to the United States of America. Approximately 65% of Manitoba’s exports to NAFTA partners (U.S. and Mexico) are transported by truck through the Emerson/Pembina crossing in southern Manitoba. Intermodal in nature, the Corridor allows cost-effective and safe movement of goods and people, minimizing both travel costs and time. Manitoba trade with the US Corridor states alone (North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas) was $15.7 billion in 2014 (Exports: $5.6 billion, Imports: $10.1 billion).\n[17377888#2] Mexican Federal Highway 180 - Highway 180 connects at the Mexico–United States border with U.S. Route 83, one of the longest north-south U.S. Highways in the United States at . Federal Highway 180 also connects to both Interstate 69E and U.S. Route 77 at the border. U.S. Route 83 (along with both Interstate 69E and U.S. Route 77) starts the northern terminus of Highway 180 in Brownsville, Texas, at the Veterans International Bridge on the Mexican border. After crossing the bridge into the United States, Federal Highway 180 continues as U.S. Route 83 in Brownsville which then runs northward to the U.S. highway's northern terminus, north of Westhope, North Dakota, at the Canada–United States border. From here, the highway continues further as Manitoba Highway 83 until it ends at Swan River, Manitoba. In total, the three highways total in length.\n[15809317#2] CanAm Highway - The CanAm Highway follows US 85 from El Paso, Texas, for to the border between the United States and Canada. It continues north on SK 35 to Weyburn, Saskatchewan, where it switches to SK 39. Then it runs north to Corinne where it continues on SK 6 until Melfort. There it changes highways again, this time to follow SK 3. That carries the CanAm Highway to Prince Albert where it continues on SK 2. The northern end is at La Ronge. The portion of the highway within Canada is ; the total length is .\n[44783025#0] Pacific Highway Border Crossing - The Pacific Highway Border Crossing connects the towns of Blaine, Washington and Surrey, British Columbia on the Canada–United States border. It is located on the Pacific Highway which runs from San Diego, California to Vancouver, British Columbia. What started as a dirt road alternative route to the Peace Arch Border Crossing in 1913, the Pacific Highway soon became the preferred route when it was paved in 1923. The part of the Pacific Highway that crosses the border here is now signed as British Columbia Highway 15 on the Canadian side and Washington State Route 543 on the American side. Since the 1970s, all commercial vehicles crossing the border between Blaine and Surrey are required to use this crossing. It is now one of the five busiest commercial border crossings on the US-Canada border.\n[70775#1] Trans-Canada Highway - Throughout much of Canada, there are at least two routes designated as part of the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH). For example, in the western provinces, both the main Trans-Canada route and the Yellowhead Highway are part of the Trans-Canada system. Although the TCH, being strictly a transcontinental route, does not enter any of Canada's three northern territories or run to the Canada–US border, the Trans-Canada Highway forms part of Canada's overall National Highway System (NHS), providing connections to the Northwest Territories, Yukon and the border, although the NHS (apart from the TCH sections) is unsigned.\n[322691#41] New Westminster - The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) is accessible from nearby Coquitlam, via the Brunette Avenue interchange, and Burnaby, via the Cariboo Road and Canada Way interchanges, and provides expressway access to Vancouver, the North Shore, and the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal (to the west), and to the British Columbia interior and the communities of the Fraser Valley (to the east, via the Port Mann Bridge). On its northern and western edges, New Westminster is connected to Vancouver by the street system of the city of Burnaby. The three major arterial streets in Burnaby connecting New Westminster and Vancouver are Canada Way (until 1967 named the Grandview Highway, and called 8th St. once it enters New Westminster), Kingsway (12th St.), and Marine Way (Stewardson Way). Kingsway connects New Westminster with the major shopping and entertainment district of Metrotown, in central Burnaby, and then proceeds to downtown Vancouver.\n[15979557#1] NAFTA superhighway - The term is also sometimes used to describe some additional partly-built or proposed highways and supercorridors which are intended to connect the road systems of the three nations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) trade bloc. One of these is Interstate 69 that is mostly complete from the Canada–US border at Port Huron, Michigan to western Kentucky. In Canada, Ontario Highway 402 and other freeways in the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor can be considered a northeastward extension of this version the NAFTA superhighway. To the southwest, from western Kentucky to the Mexican border, there is currently no single superhighway yet completed. Pending completion of I-69, the main highway links to Mexico follow parts of US routes 45 and 51 from Kentucky to western Tennessee, I-155 from Tennessee to Missouri, parts of Interstates 55 and 40 from Missouri to Arkansas, and I-30 from Arkansas to the Texas stretch of I-35 that continues south to the Mexican border at Laredo, Texas. The uncompleted section of I-69 south of Kentucky is expected to eventually continue southwestward to the Texas Gulf Coast. It will have a spur linking to the original Pan-American route through Mexico to Laredo, and additional branches extending to the Mexican spurs that cross the border at Pharr, Texas, and Brownsville, Texas.\n[15809317#0] CanAm Highway - CanAm Highway is an international highway that connects Mexico to Canada through the United States. It travels along U.S. Route 85 (US 85) and Interstate 25 (I-25), passing through six U.S. states (Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota) and the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The CanAm highway in Canada comprises Saskatchewan Highway 35 (SK 35), SK 39, SK 6, SK 3, and SK 2. The route continues south in Mexico as Mexican Federal Highway 45 (Fed. 45), and north in Canada as SK 102 but are not labeled the CanAm highway.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What language group is German?\n\nContexts: [19985174#8] Dutch language - The Germanic languages are traditionally divided into three groups: East (now extinct), West, and North Germanic. They remained mutually intelligible throughout the Migration Period. Dutch is part of the West Germanic group, which also includes English, Scots, Frisian, Low German (Old Saxon) and High German. It is characterized by a number of phonological and morphological innovations not found in North or East Germanic. The West Germanic varieties of the time are generally split into three dialect groups: Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic), Istvaeonic (Weser-Rhine Germanic) and Irminonic (Elbe Germanic). It appears that the Frankish tribes fit primarily into the Istvaeonic dialect group with certain Ingvaeonic influences towards the northwest, which are still seen in modern Dutch.\n[11884#4] German language - Within the West Germanic language dialect continuum, the Benrath and Uerdingen lines (running through Düsseldorf-Benrath and Krefeld-Uerdingen, respectively) serve to distinguish the Germanic dialects that were affected by the High German consonant shift (south of Benrath) from those that were not (north of Uerdingen). The various regional dialects spoken south of these lines are grouped as High German dialects \"(nos. 29–34 on the map)\", while those spoken to the north comprise the Low German/Low Saxon \"(nos. 19–24)\" and Low Franconian \"(no. 25)\" dialects. As members of the West Germanic language family, High German, Low German, and Low Franconian can be further distinguished historically as Irminonic, Ingvaeonic, and Istvaeonic, respectively. This classification indicates their historical descent from dialects spoken by the Irminones (also known as the Elbe group), Ingvaeones (or North Sea Germanic group), and Istvaeones (or Weser-Rhine group).\n[4066919#5] Germany–United Kingdom relations - English and German are both West Germanic languages. Modern English has diverged significantly after absorbing more French influence after 1066. English has its roots in the languages spoken by Germanic peoples from mainland Europe, more specifically various peoples came from what is now the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, including a people called the Angles after whom the English are named. Many everyday words in English are of Germanic origin and are similar to their German counterparts, and more intellectual and formal words are of French, Latin or Greek origin, but German tends to form calques of many of these. English has become a dominant world language and is widely studied in Germany. German, in the 19th and the early 20th centuries, was an important language of science and technology, but it has now largely lost that role. In English schools, German was a niche language and much less important than French. German is no longer widely studied in Britain except at the A-level in secondary schools.\n[11883#1] Germanic languages - The West Germanic languages include the three most widely spoken Germanic languages: English with around 360-400 million native speakers; German, with over 100 million native speakers; and Dutch, with 24 million native speakers. Other West Germanic languages include Afrikaans, an offshoot of Dutch, with over 7.1 million native speakers; Low German, considered a separate collection of unstandardized dialects, with roughly 0.3 million native speakers and probably 6.7–10 million people who can understand it (at least 5 million in Germany and 1.7 million in the Netherlands); Yiddish, once used by approximately 13 million Jews in pre-World War II Europe and Scots, both with 1.5 million native speakers; Limburgish varieties with roughly 1.3 million speakers along the Dutch–Belgian–German border; and the Frisian languages with over 0.5 million native speakers in the Netherlands and Germany.\n[11884#0] German language - German ( ) is a West Germanic language that is mainly spoken in Central Europe. It is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein. It is also one of the three official languages of Luxembourg and a co-official language in the Opole Voivodeship in Poland. The languages which are most similar to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch: Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, Low German/Low Saxon, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish. There are also strong similarities in vocabulary with Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, although those belong to the North Germanic group. German is the second most widely spoken Germanic language, after English.\n[11884#2] German language - German is an inflected language with four cases for nouns, pronouns and adjectives (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative), three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and strong and weak verbs. German derives the majority of its vocabulary from the ancient Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. A portion of German words are derived from Latin and Greek, and fewer are borrowed from French and Modern English. With slightly different standardized variants (German, Austrian and Swiss Standard German), German is a pluricentric language. It is also notable for its broad spectrum of dialects, with many unique varieties existing in Europe and also other parts of the world. Due to the limited intelligibility between certain varieties and Standard German, as well as the lack of an undisputed, scientific difference between a \"dialect\" and a \"language\", some German varieties or dialect groups (e.g. Low German or Plautdietsch) are alternatively referred to as \"languages\" or \"dialects\".\n[4330353#0] Northwest Germanic - Northwest Germanic is a proposed grouping of the Germanic languages, representing the current consensus among Germanic historical linguists. It does not challenge the late 19th-century tri-partite division of the Germanic dialects into North Germanic, West Germanic and East Germanic, but proposes additionally that North and West Germanic (i.e. all surviving Germanic languages today) remained as a subgroup after the southward migration of the East Germanic tribes, only splitting into North and West Germanic later. Whether this subgroup constituted a unified proto-language, or simply represents a group of dialects that remained in contact and close geographical proximity, is a matter of debate, but the formulation of Ringe and Taylor probably enjoys widespread support:\n[494575#21] Low German - Some classify the northern dialects of Low German together with English and Frisian as the \"North Sea Germanic\" or \"Ingvaeonic\" languages. However, most exclude Low German from that group often called Anglo-Frisian languages because some distinctive features of that group of languages are only partially observed in Low German, for instance the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law (some dialects have \"us\", for \"us\" whereas others have , ), and because other distinctive features do not occur in Low German at all, for instance the palatalization of /k/ (compare palatalized forms such as English \"cheese\", Frisian to non-palatalized forms such as Low German or , Dutch , German ).\n[153465#5] North Germanic languages - The Germanic languages are traditionally divided into three groups: West, East and North Germanic. Their exact relation is difficult to determine from the sparse evidence of runic inscriptions, and they remained mutually intelligible to some degree during the Migration Period, so that some individual varieties are difficult to classify. Dialects with the features assigned to the northern group formed from the Proto-Germanic language in the late Pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe.\n[1210359#6] Frankish language - The language spoken by the Franks was part of the West Germanic language group, which had features from Proto-Germanic in the late Jastorf culture (ca. 1st century BC). The West Germanic group is characterized by a number of phonological and morphological innovations not found in North and East Germanic. The West Germanic varieties of the time are generally split into three dialect groups: Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic), Istvaeonic (Weser-Rhine Germanic) and Irminonic (Elbe Germanic). While each had its own distinct characteristics, there certainly must have still been a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these dialects. In fact, it is unclear whether the West Germanic continuum of this time period, or indeed Franconian itself, should still be considered a single language or that it should be considered a collection of similar dialects.\n[1656551#24] Dutch people - As a West Germanic language, Dutch is related to other languages in that group such as West Frisian, English and German. Many West Germanic dialects underwent a series of sound shifts. The Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law and Anglo-Frisian brightening resulted in certain early Germanic languages evolving into what are now English and West Frisian, while the Second Germanic sound shift resulted in what would become (High) German. Dutch underwent none of these sound changes and thus occupies a central position in the West Germanic languages group.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: How many casualties were there in World War I?\n\nContexts: [29720951#5] Civilian casualty ratio - Some 7 million combatants on both sides are estimated to have died during World War I, along with an estimated 10 million non-combatants, including 6.6 million civilians. The civilian casualty ratio in this estimate would be about 59%. Boris Urlanis notes a lack of data on civilian losses in the Ottoman Empire, but estimates 8.6 million military killed and dead and 6 million civilians killed and dead in the other warring countries. The civilian casualty ratio in this estimate would be about 42%. Most of the civilian fatalities were due to famine, typhus, or Spanish flu rather than combat action. The relatively low ratio of civilian casualties in this war is due to the fact that the front lines on the main battlefront, the Western Front, were static for most of the war, so that civilians were able to avoid the combat zones.\n[348444#68] Persecution of Muslims - In World War I, in Ottoman-ruled Syria the total number of civilian casualties was as many as 500,000. The civilian casualties of Greater Syria, including Akkar, were covered in a detailed article by Linda Schatkowski Schilcher. Scholars acknowledge one particular reason for civilian deaths attributed to Germany (Ottoman ally in World War I), the callousness of German military officials in Syria, and systematic hoarding by the population at large.\n[33111#1] World War I casualties - The total number of deaths includes from 9 to 11 million military personnel. The civilian death toll was about 8 million, including about 6 million due to war-related famine and disease. The Triple Entente (also known as the Allies) lost about 6 million military personnel while the Central Powers lost about 4 million. At least 2 million died from diseases and 6 million went missing, presumed dead. This article lists the casualties of the belligerent powers based on official published sources.\n[27470588#19] Effects of war - Estimates for the total casualties of World War II vary, but most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about 20 million soldiers and 40 million civilians. The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people during the war, about half of all World War II casualties. The largest number of civilian deaths in a single city was 1.2 million citizens dead during the 872-day Siege of Leningrad. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 50 died in the American Civil War. Of the 60 million European soldiers who were mobilized in World War I, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.\n[1019091#19] Combat stress reaction - Unlike the Americans, the British leaders firmly held the lessons of World War I. It was estimated aerial bombardment would kill up to 35,000 a day but the entire Blitz killed 40,000. The expected torrent of civilian mental breakdown did not occur. The Government turned to World War I doctors for advice on those who did have problems. The PIE principles were generally used. However, in the British Army, since most of the World War I doctors were too old for the job, young, analytically trained psychiatrists were employed. Army doctors \"appeared to have no conception of breakdown in war and its treatment, though many of them had served in the 1914–1918 war.\" The first Middle East Force psychiatric hospital was set up in 1942. With D-Day for the first month there was a policy of holding casualties for only 48 hours before they were sent back over the Channel. This went firmly against the expectancy principle of PIE.\n[33111#6] World War I casualties - The war involved multi-ethnic empires such as Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary and Turkey. Many ethnic groups in these territories were conscripted for military service. The casualties listed by modern borders are also included in the above table of figures for the countries that existed in 1914. The casualty figures by 1924 post war borders are rough estimates by Russian historian Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century, the sources of his figures were published in the Soviet era and in post-Soviet Russia. According to the 1914–1918 Online Encyclopedia \"In addition to losses suffered by African military personnel and the laborers supporting their operations, very large, but unknown numbers of African civilians perished during the war.\" They made an estimate of civilian losses in Africa of 750,000 based on the study by the Vadim Erlikman. They noted that Erlikman's figures are based on the work of the Russian demographer Boris Urlanis, they noted that these estimates were \"imprecise\" and \"could be used to provide a frame of reference for further inquiry\". The \"Oxford History of World War One\" notes that \"In east and central Africa the harshness of the war resulted in acute shortages of food with famine in some areas, a weakening of populations, and epidemic diseases which killed hundreds of thousands of people and also cattle.\"\nThe following estimates of Austrian deaths, within contemporary borders, were made by a Russian historian in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead 175,000: including military losses 120,000 with the Austro-Hungarian forces and POW deaths in captivity of 30,000. Civilian dead due to famine and disease were 25,000.\nThe following estimates of Belarusian deaths, within contemporary borders, were made by a Russian historian in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead 130,000: including military losses 70,000 with the Russian forces. Civilian dead were 60,000.\nThe following estimates of Ukrainian deaths, within contemporary borders, were made by a Russian historian in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead 590,000: including military losses 450,000,(Erlikman did not break out military losses between Austro-Hungarian and Russian armed forces). Civilian dead were 140,000.\nThe Belgian Congo was part of the Kingdom of Belgium during the war. A Russian historian Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century based on sources published in the Soviet Union and Russia estimated a total of 155,000 deaths in the Belgian Congo during the war.\nCzechoslovakia was part of Austro-Hungary during the war. The estimates of Czechoslovak deaths within 1991 borders were made by a Russian historian in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead 185,000: including military losses 110,000 with the Austro-Hungarian forces and POW deaths in captivity of 45,000. Civilian dead due to famine and disease were 30,000. The Czechoslovak Legions fought with the armies of the Allies during the war.\nEstonia was part of the Russian Empire during the war and about 100,000 Estonians served in the Russian Army. Of them about 10,000 were killed.\nFrom 1809 Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire until the end of 1917. In 1924 the Finnish government in a reply to a questionnaire from the International Labour Office, an agency of the League of Nations, reported 26,517 were dead and missing in\n[33111#9] World War I casualties - The following estimates of Hungarian deaths, within contemporary borders, during World War I were made by a Russian historian in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead 385,000: including military losses 270,000 with the Austro-Hungarian forces and POW deaths in captivity of 70,000. Civilian dead due to famine and disease were 45,000.\nIreland was a part of the UK during World War I. Five-sixths of the island left to form the Irish Free State, now the Republic of Ireland, in 1922. A total of 206,000 Irishmen served in the British forces during the war. The number of Irish deaths in the British Army recorded by the registrar general was 27,405. A significant number of these casualties were from what, in 1920, became Northern Ireland. While 49,400 soldiers died serving in Irish divisions (the 10th, 16th and 36th), although not all of the men serving in these divisions were natives of Ireland and many Irish who died in non-Irish regiments are not listed. For example, 29% of the casualties in the 16th Division were not natives of Ireland. Neither does it include Irish emigrants in Britain who enlisted there and are not categorised as Irish. Australia lists 4,731 of its first World War soldiers as having been born in Ireland and more than 19,000 Irish-born soldiers served in the Canadian Corps. According to research done by John Horne of Trinity College Dublin, there are at least 30,986 soldiers who were born in Ireland that died; however, that's considered a \"conservative\" estimate and is very likely to raise.\nThe losses of Portuguese Mozambique were estimated by a Russian historian Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Erlikman's estimates are based on sources published in the Soviet Union and Russia. 52,000\nPoland was territory of Germany, Austria-Hungary and partially annexed by Russia, from 1795 to 1918. By late 1915, Germany had complete control over modern-day Poland. A 2005 Polish study estimated 3,376,800 Poles were conscripted into the armed forces of these countries during World War I, an additional 300,000 were conscripted for forced labor by the Germans. The Russians and Austrians forcibly resettled 1.6 to 1.8 million persons from the war zone in Poland. According to Michael Clodfelter, Polish war dead were 1,080,000, whilst 200,000 Polish civilians were killed in the fighting on the Eastern Front; 870,000 men served in the German, Austrian and Russian armies. Another estimate made by a Russian historian in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century, put total Polish war dead at 640,000, including military losses of 270,000 Poles conscripted, civilian losses of 120,000 due to military operations and 250,000 caused by famine and disease. The ethnic Polish Blue Army served with the French Army. The ethnic Polish Legions fought as part of the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front.\nThe territory of Transylvania was part of Austria-Hungary during World War I. The following estimates of Romanian deaths, within contemporary borders, during World War I were made by a Russian historian in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century. Total dead: 748,000, including military losses of 220,000 with the Romanian forces, 150,000 with the Austro-Hungarian forces and POW deaths in captivity of 48,000. Civilian dead were as follows due to famine and\n[33111#0] World War I casualties - The total number of military and civilian casualties in World War I were about 40 million: estimates range from 15 to 19 million deaths and about 23 million wounded military personnel, ranking it among the deadliest conflicts in human history.\n[7485346#2] Ottoman casualties of World War I - Among the 5 million, 771,844 were military casualties killed in action and other causes. The military only covers 15% of the total casualties. The main question is what happened to 85% (spread over all millets) of the casualties, which is more but not less than 4,000,000. Ottoman statistics analyzed by Turkish Kamer Kasim (Manchester University, Ph.D.), claims that cumulative percentage was 26.9% (higher than 25% reported by western sources) of the population, which this size stands out among the countries that took part in World War I. To understand the size of the issue, Kamer Kasım's %1.9 increase on the totals adds 399,000 civilians to the total number, which has not been reported in western sources.\n[33111#3] World War I casualties - Casualty statistics for World War I vary to a great extent; estimates of total deaths range from 9 million to over 15 million. Military casualties reported in official sources list deaths due to all causes, including an estimated 7 to 8 million combat related deaths (killed or died of wounds) and another two to three million military deaths caused by accidents, disease and deaths while prisoners of war. Official government reports listing casualty statistics were published by the United States and Great Britain. These secondary sources published during the 1920s, are the source of the statistics in reference works listing casualties in World War I. This article summarizes the casualty statistics published in the official government reports of the United States and Great Britain as well as France, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Austria and Russia. More recently the research of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) has revised the military casualty statistics of the UK and its allies; they include in their listing of military war dead personnel outside of combat theaters and civilians recruited from Africa, the Middle East and China who provided logistical and service support in combat theaters. The casualties of these support personnel recruited outside of Europe were previously not included with British war dead, however the casualties of the Labour Corps recruited from the British Isles were included in the rolls of British war dead published in 1921. The methodology used by each nation to record and classify casualties was not uniform, a general caveat regarding casualty figures is that they cannot be considered comparable in all cases.\n[26048493#5] Effect of World War I on children in the United States - Over the course of the war, the United States mobilized hundreds of thousands of men and endured an estimated 117,465 casualties. Of the men who survived and returned home, post-traumatic stress disorder created a major impact on society. During this time, and still today, post-traumatic stress (then more likely to be known as \"shell shock\") was not fully understood, but because of the traumatic nature of battle, many men were negatively affected after the war. Some men were forced to leave battle, which many people considered cowardice, and there were asylums throughout Europe housing men suffering from this condition. In some extreme cases, men were even shot for showing weakness. There are still people living today who lost family members because of this practice, which created lasting impacts on these children. Additionally, many of these men were teenagers when they left for war, and virtually all were under the age of 30; therefore many of these soldiers were barely out of childhood themselves.\n[3093402#94] Middle Eastern theatre of World War I - Estimates for Ottoman military casualties vary widely, as the disintegration of the Ottoman bureaucracy and government meant 1,565,000 men simply became unaccounted for in the records following the end of the war. The Ottoman official casualty statistics published in 1922 were 325,000 dead (50,000 killed, 35,000 died of wounds, 240,000 died of disease), 400,000 wounded, and an unknown number of prisoners. The United States War Department used the same killed and wounded figures, and estimated that 250,000 Ottoman soldiers had gone missing or become prisoners before the end of the war, for a total of 975,000 casualties. American historian Edward J. Erickson, based on non-published individual World War I campaign histories in the Ottoman Archives, estimated Ottoman military casualties at 1,680,701: 771,844 dead/missing (175,220 killed in action, 68,378 died of wounds, 61,487 missing action, and 466,759 deaths due to disease), 695,375 wounded (total of 763,753 wounded including those who died of wounds and 303,150 actually listed in records; the author assumes these are only the seriously wounded, and estimates the rest), and 145,104 prisoners of war. The very high ratio of disease deaths to combat deaths is attributed to the breakdown of the Ottoman medical services, which resulted in afflictions that would normally be treated after evacuation from the theater in the British army often being fatal in the Ottoman army. Including those who died of disease, 3,515,471 Ottoman troops fell sick during World War I.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When did the Ateneo–La Salle rivalry begin?\n\nContexts: [5610830#93] De La Salle Green Archers - Since 1924 when the NCAA was founded La Salle has always enjoyed a very competitive and fierce rivalry with Ateneo. As of 2018, the De La Salle Green Archers has more collegiate championships compared to Ateneo in the NCAA and UAAP combined. La Salle has 176 collegiate titles versus the Ateneo Blue Eagles with 101 collegiate titles. La Salle also has 8 Overall (General) Collegiate Championships versus Ateneo with 1 Overall (General) Collegiate Championship. This rivalry has been claimed to be as early as 1939, when both schools were still competing in the NCAA.\n[18364790#1] Ateneo–La Salle rivalry - La Salle and Ateneo were co-founders of the NCAA but now compete in the UAAP. The seed for a future rivalry was planted after an Ateneo loss to La Salle in the championship game of NCAA season 16 (1939–40). Games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hotly contested but not yet tagged by the sportswriters as a rivalry since the recognized rivalry then was between Ateneo and San Beda, and La Salle and Letran. When Ateneo and La Salle transferred to the UAAP 1978 and 1986 respectively, they continued their hotly contested games and the sports press started to write about a rivalry. The basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle are currently the most anticipated in every UAAP season. These games draw huge crowd of students, school faculty/ officials, alumni, actors and actresses, musicians, business tycoons, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators, congressmen and justices of the Supreme Court also Former presidents of the Philippines and ambassadors of the United States of America also attend the games. Both schools have extended their rivalry into the academic field and other sports.\n[1929415#39] National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) - Arguably the most popular rivalry in Filipino sports was forged in the NCAA: the Ateneo–La Salle rivalry. Historical records are unclear on when the rivalry began, although there are arguments pointing to La Salle's 1939 defeat of a top-seeded Ateneo basketball team and their being dethroned by the Ateneans who beat the Lasallites in the elimination round. While La Salle held their victory parade, they threw fried chickens at the Padre Faura gate of the Ateneo. However. the La Salle cage team was disbarred for fielding an ineligible player the following year (although the title would not become Ateneo's until 1941, two years after the defeat).\n[1929415#40] National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) - Ateneo–La Salle games were always heated, for both schools were exclusively for males. However, La Salle during its stint in the NCAA was not as strong a contender as Ateneo was \"(see Ateneo–San Beda rivalry)\", with Ateneo not meeting La Salle again until the 1958 Finals, where Ateneo prevailed. Ateneo–La Salle games are now some of the most anticipated games of the UAAP season.\n[18364790#25] Ateneo–La Salle rivalry - Ateneo won the championship in 1987 by prevailing over UE in the first head to head championship match up between the two schools. La Salle won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals, capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped off the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. The two teams most recently met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, the Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school. Ateneo failed to enter the Final Four in 2013 while La Salle won the title for the first time since 2007. Both teams failed to enter the Finals in 2014. In 2015, both teams failed once again to enter the Finals with La Salle missing the Final Four for the first time since 2011, while Ateneo made it to the semifinals but lost to the eventual champions FEU Tamaraws, who also ousted La Salle in their last game (a game in which La Salle needed to win to stay in contention and force a knockout match) for the last Final Four slot in which enabled the erstwhile defending champions NU Bulldogs to grab the #4 position in the playoffs. In 2016 both teams met in the Finals for the first time since 2008 with both schools taking the Top 2 spots at the end of the elimination rounds and having the twice to beat advantage, with La Salle outlasting Adamson in one game, while Ateneo used their twice to beat advantage to take out the defending champions FEU Tamaraws in a hard-fought series with Ateneo winning the second game in an overtime thriller in which both teams did not score more than five points in the extra period. In the finals the Green Archers swept the Blue Eagles to win their 9th title and break the tie among them for the number of UAAP titles. In 2017, both Ateneo and La Salle met once again in the Finals and the first back-to-back Ateneo-La Salle Finals series since 2002 with Ateneo winning this time in a 3-game series that ended their 5-year title drought and dethroned La Salle.\n[18364790#43] Ateneo–La Salle rivalry - La Salle paraded several rookies for the 2009 season, while Ateneo emerged with only Chris Tiu as the major graduating player. With these conditions, the first Ateneo–La Salle game came at the heels of former President Corazon Aquino's death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.\n[5610762#16] Ateneo Blue Eagles - While the Ateneo-San Beda rivalry was ongoing, the seed for a future rivalry was planted after an Ateneo loss to La Salle in the championship game of NCAA season 16 (1939–40). Games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hotly contested but not yet tagged by the sportswriters as a rivalry. When Ateneo and La Salle transferred to the UAAP, San Beda was left in the NCAA. Ateneo and La Salle continued their hotly contested games into the UAAP and the sports press started to write about a rivalry. The basketball games between the Blue Eagles and the Green Archers are the most anticipated matches in every UAAP season. During the 1988 season, Ateneo was the defending champion and they faced La Salle in the Finals. A deep Ateneo lineup ended up winning the crown, triggering a full-blown rivalry. Recently, the intensity of the rivalry has picked up due to Ateneo and La Salle meeting in the UAAP Finals 5 times, in 2001 (won by La Salle), 2002 (won by Ateneo), 2008 (won by Ateneo), 2016 (won by La Salle) and 2017 (won by Ateneo). The UAAP is guaranteed high TV ratings and sold-out tickets, resulting in ticket scalping, when Ateneo and La Salle clash on the hardcourt. These games draw huge crowds of students, school faculty/officials, alums, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators and even a chief justice of the Supreme Court. Former presidents of the Philippines and ambassadors of the United States of America also attend the games.\n[18364790#95] Ateneo–La Salle rivalry - In baseball, Ateneo leads La Salle 6–4. Prior to Ateneo's 10-year curse, in 1991, La Salle lost to Ateneo 10–5 for Ateneo's last victory before the infamous losing streak. It took 13 years before Ateneo could beat La Salle when in 2004, Johnel Clemente's game-winning RBI single off La Salle pitcher Angel Gabriel nailed Ateneo's victory, 9–8. In 2006, Ateneo handed La Salle its first humiliating 10-run loss, 17–7, on Jonathan Sibal's 2-RBI single off pitcher Jeff Ardio which ended the game prematurely at the 8th inning (mercy rule). La Salle actually led 7–4 in the 4th inning before Ateneo exploded for 9 runs and put the game out of reach. In 2009, Ateneo and La Salle combined for what may be the highest scoring game in UAAP Baseball history when Ateneo defeated La Salle, 27–14. The most recent championship meeting between the two teams was in UAAP Season 78, when La Salle dethroned Ateneo who were the 3-peat defending champions.\n[18364790#24] Ateneo–La Salle rivalry - In 1939, La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship. A legend states that the rivalry reputedly started that year when after La Salle defeated Ateneo, then the defending champions, La Salle students threw fried chicken outside the gates of the old Ateneo campus in Manila. Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the championship again until 1958 where Ateneo defeated La Salle by a basket in overtime. Another finals meeting of both schools took place in 1974 with La Salle prevailing over Ateneo in the championship. Ateneo and La Salle left the NCAA in 1978 and 1981 respectively after games turned into full-blown riots, with Ateneo leaving after losing the 1978 championship against San Beda in closed doors, and La Salle after fan disturbance in their 1980 second-round game against Letran.\n[18364790#59] Ateneo–La Salle rivalry - The two universities are also represented in the high school level, with the Ateneo de Manila High School and La Salle Green Hills (1968–1981), De La Salle Zobel (1986–present). And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When La Salle Green Hills used to be the Juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the Ateneo High School and the LSGH High School are both all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School, the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Who won the Battle of Vienna?\n\nContexts: [84274#27] Battle of Vienna - The Ottoman troops were tired and dispirited following the failure of the attempt at sapping, the assault on the city and the advance of the Holy League infantry on the Türkenschanze. The cavalry charge was the final deadly blow. Less than three hours after the cavalry attack, the Christian forces had won the battle and saved Vienna. The first Christian officer who entered Vienna was Margrave Ludwig of Baden, at the head of his dragoons. Afterwards Sobieski paraphrased Julius Caesar's famous quotation (\"Veni, vidi, vici\") by saying \"\"Veni, vidi, Deus vicit\"\"—\"I came, I saw, God conquered\".\n[32066893#11] Battle of Vienna, Virginia - The Union officers were criticized for not sending skirmishers in front of the train which had moved slowly along the track and for disregarding the warning given to them by the local Union sympathizer. The Battle of Vienna followed the Union defeat at the Battle of Big Bethel only a week earlier and historian William C. Davis noted that \"the press were much agitated by the minor repulse at Vienna on June 17, and the people were beginning to ask when the Federals would gain some victories.\"\n[2353203#1] Battle of Mohács (1687) - The Great Turkish War began in July 1683 with an attack on Vienna by the Ottoman army. The siege was broken by the Battle of Vienna on 12 September, won by the combined forces of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nations and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, under the overall command of the King of Poland, John III Sobieski, who led the Polish forces. From September the initiative passed to the imperial troops. In the following years the Imperial Habsburg armies under Charles of Lorraine drove the Ottomans back, conquering many fortresses (such as Esztergom, Vác, Pest). After the Battle of Buda they laid siege to and took over the former Hungarian capital of Buda. At the end of 1686 the Ottomans made peace overtures; however, the Imperial Habsburgs saw a chance to conquer the whole of Hungary and the overtures were rejected.\n[84274#0] Battle of Vienna - The Battle of Vienna ( or \"Kahlenberg\" (Battle of the Bald Mountains); or \"odsiecz wiedeńska\" (The Relief of Vienna); Modern Turkish: \"İkinci Viyana Kuşatması\", Ottoman Turkish: \"Beç Ḳalʿası Muḥāṣarası\") took place at Kahlenberg Mountain near Vienna on 1683 after the imperial city had been besieged by the Ottoman Empire for two months. The battle was fought by the Habsburg Monarchy, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Holy Roman Empire, under the command of King John III Sobieski against the Ottomans and their vassal and tributary states. The battle marked the first time the Commonwealth and the Holy Roman Empire had cooperated militarily against the Ottomans, and it is often seen as a turning point in history, after which \"the Ottoman Turks ceased to be a menace to the Christian world\". In the ensuing war that lasted until 1699, the Ottomans lost almost all of Hungary to the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.\n[84274#20] Battle of Vienna - The confederated troops signaled their arrival on the Kahlenberg above Vienna with bonfires. The forces in the city of Vienna responded by sending a Polish-Ukrainian former Zaporozhian Cossack and trader who was fluent in Turkish, by the name of Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki, in a successful spy mission to penetrate the Turkish forces and notify the relief troops of when the joint attack was to be made. Before the battle a Mass was celebrated, said by Marco d'Aviano, the religious adviser of Emperor Leopold I.\n[32066893#1] Battle of Vienna, Virginia - The Union was trying to protect the areas of Virginia opposite Washington, D.C., and established a camp at Vienna, at the end of a 15-mile railroad to Alexandria. As Union Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck was transporting the 1st Ohio Infantry to Vienna by train, they were overheard by Confederate scouts led by Colonel Maxcy Gregg, who set up an ambush. They hit the train with two cannon shots, inflicting casualties of eight killed and four wounded, before the Union men escaped into the woods. The engineer had fled with the locomotive, so the Union force had to retreat on foot. The Confederates briefly attempted a pursuit in the dark, but it was called off.\n[84274#1] Battle of Vienna - The battle was won by the combined forces of the Holy Roman Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the latter represented only by the forces of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland (the march of the Lithuanian army was delayed, and they reached Vienna after it had been relieved). The Viennese garrison was led by Ernst Rüdiger Graf von Starhemberg, an Austrian subject of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I. The overall command was held by the senior leader, the King of Poland, John III Sobieski, who led the relief forces.\n[26531491#4] The Battle (Patrick Rimbaud novel) - The narration picks up the action in Vienna on May 16, 1809 and introduces colonel Louis-François Lejeune, a professional soldier and officer of the General Staff; he and Napoleon are the pivotal characters of the novel. As a liaison officer, Lejeune has access to Napoleon and his entourage. Napoleon is shown \"as a foul-mouthed, callous bully, driven by vanity and detested even by his closest comrades.\" The book describes Napoleon's preparations for the battle, his hasty and ultimately disastrous decision to build a pontoon bridge across the raging Danube, and his often tense relationship with his subordinates, among them André Masséna, Pierre Daru, Jean-Baptiste Bessières, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Jean Boudet, Jean-Baptiste Marbot, and the fatally wounded Jean Lannes. The two-day battle is described in gory detail, including the mass murder of hundreds of prisoners. Lejeune’s friend is Henry Beyle, later known as Stendhal, who, afflicted with syphilis, remains in Vienna as an observer; they both have a common love interest in Anna Krauss, an Austrian woman.\n[2109648#10] Döbling - Throughout the centuries the suburb, due to its strategic location (elevated in respect to the centre of Vienna) was occupied and often looted. The decisive encounter of the Battle of Vienna in 1683 was fought on September 12, between Jan III Sobieski and the forces of the Ottoman Empire, commanded by the Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha.\nAt the 2010 elections the FPÖ won 6.3% and reached 14.7% The Greens lost 0.3% and now have 13.6%. \nThe ÖVP lost dramatically 4.3% and now only has 36.4%, the SPÖ lost 2.5% and now only has 31.8%. \nThe BZÖ could practically double itself through winning of 0.6% up to now 1,3%, whereas the KPÖ reached 0.8% and is stagnating.\n[32066893#15] Battle of Vienna, Virginia - The Town of Vienna has given the name of \"Battle Street\" to a street near the battle site. To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the battle, the Town hosted in 1961 a battle reenactment that featured a steam train that operated on the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad's tracks, which were still in active use. The Town also commemorated the 125th anniversary of the battle in 1986. On June 18, 2011, the Town and other organizations presented a reenactment of the battle near its site to commemorate the battle's 150th anniversary. That reenactment featured a replica steam locomotive that had been leased from the Town of Strasburg, Virginia for $2,500 and transported to Vienna.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What is the life expectancy of a horse?\n\nContexts: [54401862#12] Prospect Point (horse) - It is unknown as to why Prospect Point lived as long as he did. The average life expectancy for a Thoroughbred is between the ages of 25-28.\n[13645#5] Horse - Depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years. Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond. The oldest verifiable record was \"Old Billy\", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62. In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in \"Guinness World Records\" as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.\n[32254689#1] Horse Latitudes (album) - Writing for Allmusic, critic William Ruhlman wrote that \"Singer/songwriter Jeffrey Foucault likes to play in a familiar, slow-moving country-folk style; this is a guy who has been to the desert on \"A Horse with No Name,\" searching for a \"Heart of Gold.\" The lyrical reflections he expresses so introspectively also tend to be spare and allusive... For the most part, however, Foucault is a miniaturist as interested in evoking mood as meaning in his atmospheric music, expecting his listeners to fill in the blanks.\" David Kleiner of Minor 7th wrote \"Writers should check out Foucault's similes, here (\"singing / darker than the sea\") and throughout (\"smoking like a river / in the dark before the dawn\"), as the comparison is always unexpected and richer for it... What you remember is, \"When I had one good coat, I was warm.\" You disappear. Only Foucault's songs remain, as haunting as they are haunted.\"\n[21866354#116] British Army during the Victorian Era - The cavalry, obsessed with the charge with cold steel, had \"ceased to be in any useful sense mobile\". They used heavy chargers as mounts rather than lighter horses. The heavy mounts required acclimatisation and recovery after long sea voyages, and needed plenty of forage when grazing was sparse. They were also overloaded with unnecessary or over-decorated equipment and saddlery. The average life expectancy of a British horse from the time of its arrival in South Africa was around six weeks.\n[13645#22] Horse - Depending on maturity, breed, and work expected, horses are usually put under saddle and trained to be ridden between the ages of two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses specifically bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60 calendar months (five years) old.\n[2296094#34] Field artillery in the American Civil War - Horses were required to pull the enormous weight of the cannon and ammunition; on average, each horse pulled about 700 pounds (317.5 kg). Each gun in a battery used two six-horse teams (for normal field artillery; heavier guns required much larger teams): one team pulled a limber that attached to the trail of the gun to form a four-wheeled wagon of sorts; the other pulled a limber that attached to a caisson. The large number of horses posed a logistical challenge for the artillery, because they had to be fed, maintained, and replaced when worn out or injured. Artillery horses were generally selected second from the pool of high quality animals; cavalry mounts were the best horses. The life expectancy of an artillery horse was under eight months. They suffered from disease, exhaustion from long marches—typically 16 miles (25.8 km) in 10 hours—and battle injuries.\n[42720#107] Second Boer War - The number of horses killed in the war was at the time unprecedented in modern warfare. For example, in the Relief of Kimberley, French's cavalry rode 500 horses to their deaths in a single day. The wastage was particularly heavy among British forces for several reasons: overloading of horses with unnecessary equipment and saddlery, failure to rest and acclimatise horses after long sea voyages and, later in the war, poor management by inexperienced mounted troops and distant control by unsympathetic staffs. The average life expectancy of a British horse, from the time of its arrival in Port Elizabeth, was around six weeks.\n[43063267#3] Dark Horse (Twista album) - He explained the album title, saying: \"If you listen to it, and look at some of the old cats who’ve used the title before, one of The Beatles [George Harrison] was actually called “the dark horse” before, because you didn’t know how much of his musical involvement had a hand in what Beatles material came out. The dark horse meaning, like, the least expected person to win the race, or the least expected person to win the Super Bowl. I look at the dark horse as the person that you don’t always expect to see coming out on top. I consider myself a dark horse in the industry.\"\n[43808777#4] C.W. Parker Carousel Museum - Each wooden carousel horse that is attached to the operational carousel required several hours of restoration labor. Upon arrival to the museum, many of these artifacts dated close to 100 years old, and had an original life expectancy of around five years. Due to wood rot, many of the horses had to be completely re-carved by hand. The process of re-carving utilized the same primitive tools that would have been used in the original making. It is estimated that thousands of hours of labor were volunteered to complete the projects. To keep with historical building styles, each horse contains wooden dowels instead of nails (Reinhardt,2014).\n[9659164#10] Aging in dogs - Life expectancy usually varies within a range. For example, a Beagle (average life expectancy 13.3 years) usually lives to around 12–15 years, and a Scottish Terrier (average life expectancy 12 years) usually lives to around 10–16 years.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When did psychology start being practiced?\n\nContexts: [492271#4] Clinical psychology - By the second half of the 1800s, the scientific study of psychology was becoming well established in university laboratories. Although there were a few scattered voices calling for an applied psychology, the general field looked down upon this idea and insisted on \"pure\" science as the only respectable practice. This changed when Lightner Witmer (1867–1956), a past student of Wundt and head of the psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed to treat a young boy who had trouble with spelling. His successful treatment was soon to lead to Witmer's opening of the first psychological clinic at Penn in 1896, dedicated to helping children with learning disabilities. Ten years later in 1907, Witmer was to found the first journal of this new field, \"The Psychological Clinic\", where he coined the term \"clinical psychology\", defined as \"the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, with the intention of promoting change\". The field was slow to follow Witmer's example, but by 1914, there were 26 similar clinics in the U.S.\n[83859#42] Adolescence - The formal study of adolescent psychology began with the publication of G. Stanley Hall's \"Adolescence in 1904\". Hall, who was the first president of the American Psychological Association, viewed adolescence primarily as a time of internal turmoil and upheaval (\"sturm und drang\"). This understanding of youth was based on two then new ways of understanding human behavior: Darwin's evolutionary theory and Freud's psychodynamic theory. He believed that adolescence was a representation of our human ancestors' phylogenetic shift from being primitive to being civilized. Hall's assertions stood relatively uncontested until the 1950s when psychologists such as Erik Erikson and Anna Freud started to formulate their theories about adolescence. Freud believed that the psychological disturbances associated with youth were biologically based and culturally universal while Erikson focused on the dichotomy between identity formation and role fulfillment. Even with their different theories, these three psychologists agreed that adolescence was inherently a time of disturbance and psychological confusion. The less turbulent aspects of adolescence, such as peer relations and cultural influence, were left largely ignored until the 1980s. From the '50s until the '80s, the focus of the field was mainly on describing patterns of behavior as opposed to explaining them.\n[492271#1] Clinical psychology - The field is generally considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the USA—the Ph.D. Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research), the Ph.D. science-practitioner model (integrating research and practice), and the Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model (focusing on clinical practice). In the UK and the Republic of Ireland the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe the training is at masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations—psychodynamic, humanistic, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and systems or family therapy.\n[9709265#33] Buddhism and psychology - An important event in the interchange of East and West occurred when American psychologist William James invited the Sri Lankan Buddhist Anagarika Dharmapala to lecture in his classes at Harvard University in December 1903. After Dharmapala lectured on Buddhism, James remarked, “This is the psychology everybody will be studying 25 years from now.” Later scholars such as David Kalupahana (The principles of Buddhist psychology, 1987), Padmal de Silva (Buddhism and behaviour modification, 1984), Edwina Pio (Buddhist Psychology: A Modern Perspective, 1988) and Hubert Benoit (Zen and the Psychology of Transformation, 1990) wrote about and compared Buddhism and Psychology directly. Writers in the field of Transpersonal psychology (which deals with religious experience, altered states of consciousness and similar topics) such as Ken Wilber also integrated Buddhist thought and practice into their work.\n[10562714#5] Prescriptive authority for psychologists movement - The State of New Mexico was the first to enact a Psychologists prescribing law, which is still in effect. Louisiana's legislature established medical psychology as a separate and distinct healthcare profession and transferred the regulation of their practice of medical psychology to the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners. At this time, the entire practice of psychology (for medical psychologist), including psychotherapy and psychological testing, was also transferred to the Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners, effectively making Louisiana the only state in the U.S. where, for some psychologists, a medical board has authority over the regulation of the entire practice of psychology. Because of this, several national organizations, including the American Psychological Association and the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards have expressed concern over the practice of psychology being regulated by another profession (i.e., medicine). The Louisiana Psychological Association has strongly echoed such concerns. However, the Louisiana Academy of Medical Psychologists, a Political Action Committee representing medical psychologists in that state, strongly endorsed this change of regulation by another profession.\n[10332#3] Educational psychology - Educational psychology has seen rapid growth and development as a profession in the last twenty years. School psychology began with the concept of intelligence testing leading to provisions for special education students, who could not follow the regular classroom curriculum in the early part of the 20th century. However, \"school psychology\" itself has built a fairly new profession based upon the practices and theories of several psychologists among many different fields. Educational psychologists are working side by side with psychiatrists, social workers, teachers, speech and language therapists, and counselors in attempt to understand the questions being raised when combining behavioral, cognitive, and social psychology in the classroom setting.\n[51416401#1] Psychology and Social Critique - Psychology & Social Critique was founded in 1977 as »Psychology & Society« (German: Psychologie und Gesellschaft) by Siegfied Grubitzsch and Günter Rexilius. Peter Mattes is the only founding member who belongs to the editorial team to this day. The journal was renamed »Psychology & Social Critique« in 1979 to mark its contrast from the book series called »Psychology & Society«. P&G was founded as a critical psychological journal but its authors pursued different paths than the Holzkamp school by consciously refraining from developing an overarching theoretical tradition. As a consequence, P&G refused to be pinned down to a unifying consensus. In contrast to Holzkamp’s Critical Psychology, Marxist social theory has become somewhat less significant in this process. P&G is characterized by key topics rather than a theoretical framework. These topics build the central nodes of critical psychological discussion at P&G. Selected topics (in chronological order) include: psychiatry, psychotherapy, psychosocial practice (1978–80); psychology and politics, psychology during National Socialism (1979/80); aesthetic practices, mass communication and the media (1981); measurements, the industrialized psyche (1982); therapeutic practice, institutional practice, social control (1983/84); women and social (from 1983); identity]], subjectivity]], subject and politics (1987/89); National Socialism, euthanasia, and modernization (1991); postmodern challenges, construction, being oneself (1992/93), subject construction and subjectification (1996ff.), gender, childhood, and adolescence (since 2002), critical-psychoanalytic topics and articles (since 2003), and, again and again, critical-deconstructivist reflections on diverse aspects of life, culture, and institutions. Since the 1990s, the journal has witnessed an increasing influence of poststructuralist and discourse analytic concepts and of French and North-American postmodernist philosophy as well as social constructionism. Psychology & Social Critique has considerably diversified social psychologies in the German speaking countries. The critique of psychology, as exemplified by Psychology & Social Critique, deconstructs power and seeks out possibilities, in and around psychology, to think differently, to entertain discourses of ‘desubjugation’ (Foucault), and to defy the dictates of normal scientific discourse. \nSince the mid 1990s, the journal is being edited by an editorial collective with alternating members. Editorial members came mostly from the German Federal Republic and the West Berlin scene initially and from German and Austrian universities, where they engaged in research and teaching that offered alternatives to the psychological mainstream, since the 1990s. A heavy focus lay on the universities Bielefeld, Oldenburg, GH Wuppertal, Bremen, FU Berlin, and later Munich, Erlangen-Nurnberg, and Vienna. Over the years, Psychology & Social Critique has reconstructed, accompanied, and actively influenced critical intellectual discourse in and around psychology with its core topics. \nPsychology & Social Critique is published as a German speaking journal quarterly (two of the four annual issues usually constitute a double issue). P&G is currently (as of 2014) in its 38th year and will publish its 150th thematic issue in 2014. P&G participates in the Social Science Open Access Repository (SSOAR) and provides of all articles for download. Papers published within the previous two years are not available for open access.\n[505326#1] Counseling psychology - The term \"counselling\" is of American origin, coined by Rogers, who, lacking a medical qualification was prevented from calling his work psychotherapy. In the U.S., counselling psychology, like many modern psychology specialties, started as a result of World War II. During the war, the U.S. military had a strong need for vocational placement and training. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Veterans Administration created a specialty called \"counseling psychology\", and Division 17 (now known as the Society for Counseling Psychology) of the APA was formed. The Society of Counseling Psychology unites psychologists, students and professionals who are dedicated to promote education and training, practice, scientific investigation, diversity and public interest in the field of professional psychology. This fostered interest in counselor training, and the creation of the first few counseling psychology PhD programs. The first counseling psychology PhD programs were at the University of Minnesota; Ohio State University; University of Maryland, College Park; University of Missouri; Teachers College, Columbia University; and University of Texas at Austin.\n[482388#4] Doctor of Psychology - While the scientist-practitioner model “stood intransigent and impervious through the 1950s and 60s”, the APA attempted to respond to pressure for more and better clinical training by forming the Committee on the Scientific and Professional Aims of Psychology in 1963. The Committee concluded that the scientist-practitioner model failed to do either of the jobs for which it was designed and recommended several important changes, including: establishing separate practice-oriented programs, potentially in locations other than university psychology departments; developing a practice-oriented training model; and using the Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) degree to designate preparation for clinical practice. The Committee's conclusions and recommendations met with controversy. In particular, opponents said a different degree would impact the field's prestige and ignore science. Proponents, however, argued it would be informed by science and that other practice-oriented healthcare disciplines, such as medicine, had well-respected professional degrees.\n[492271#9] Clinical psychology - By the 1960s, psychotherapy had become embedded within clinical psychology, but for many the Ph.D. educational model did not offer the necessary training for those interested in practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the U.S. had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. The concept of a practice-oriented degree was debated in 1965 and narrowly gained approval for a pilot program at the University of Illinois starting in 1968. Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the Vail Conference on Professional Training in Psychology, the practitioner–scholar model of clinical psychology—or \"Vail Model\"—resulting in the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) degree was recognized. Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. The first program explicitly based on the Psy.D. model was instituted at Rutgers University. Today, about half of all American graduate students in clinical psychology are enrolled in Psy.D. programs.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Did Gollum know Bilbo before he was turned?\n\nContexts: [30292#9] The Hobbit - The group travels into the wild, where Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to Rivendell, where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map. Passing over the Misty Mountains, they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground. Although Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles across a mysterious ring and then encounters Gollum, who engages him in a game of riddles. As a reward for solving all riddles Gollum will show him the path out of the tunnels, but if Bilbo fails, his life will be forfeit. With the help of the ring, which confers invisibility, Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them. The goblins and Wargs give chase, but the company are saved by eagles before resting in the house of Beorn.\n[23140032#11] Frodo Baggins - Frodo and Sam made their way through Emyn Muil, followed by the creature Gollum, who had been tracking the Fellowship since Moria, seeking to reclaim the Ring he had possessed for centuries. After Gollum attacked the hobbits, Frodo subdued him with Sting. He then took pity on Gollum, and spared his life (just as Bilbo had done in \"The Hobbit\"), instead binding him to a promise to guide them through the Dead Marshes to the Black Gate, which Gollum did. Gollum said that there was \"another way\" into Mordor, and Frodo, over Sam's objections, allowed him to lead them south into Ithilien. It was there that they met Faramir, younger brother of Boromir, who took them to Henneth Annûn. There Frodo allowed Gollum to be captured by Faramir, saving Gollum's life but leaving him feeling betrayed by his \"master\". After giving them provisions, Faramir allowed the two hobbits and Gollum to go on their way, but warned Frodo of Gollum's treachery.\n[23140913#29] One Ring - As is told in \"The Hobbit\", Bilbo found the Ring shortly afterward while lost in the tunnels near Gollum's lair. When \"The Hobbit\" was written, Tolkien had not yet conceived of the Ring's sinister history. Thus, in the first edition of \"The Hobbit\", Gollum offers to surrender the Ring to Bilbo as a reward for winning the Riddle Game. When Tolkien revised the nature of the Ring for \"The Lord of the Rings\", he realized that the Ring's grip on Gollum would never permit him to give it up willingly. Tolkien therefore revised the second edition of \"The Hobbit\": after losing the Riddle Game to Bilbo, Gollum went to get his \"Precious\" (as he always called it) so he could kill and eat Bilbo, but flew into a rage when he found the Ring missing. Deducing from Bilbo's last question—\"What have I got in my pocket?\"—that Bilbo had found the Ring, Gollum chased him through the caves, not realizing that the hobbit had discovered the Ring's powers of invisibility and was following him to the cave's exit. Bilbo escaped Gollum and the goblins by remaining invisible, but when he rejoined Gandalf and the dwarves he was travelling with, he decided not to tell them that the Ring had made him invisible. In fact he told them a story that closely followed the first edition of \"The Hobbit\": that Gollum had given him the Ring and showed him the way out. Gandalf was not convinced and later forced the real story from Bilbo; he was thus immediately suspicious of the Ring.\n[9378946#8] The Hobbit (2003 video game) - On the first night of the quest, the entire company is captured by three trolls, who plan to eat them. However, Gandalf arrives, imitating the trolls' voices and causing them to fight amongst themselves until the sun rises, which turns them to stone. As Bilbo searches for supplies in their cave, he meets an injured elf, Lianna (Jennifer Hale), who he assists by finding her healing potion. He also finds a dagger, which he calls Sting. The party then move on to the Elven city of Rivendell, where Elrond tells them of a secret entrance into the Lonely Mountain. They then head to the Misty Mountains. During the night, they are attacked by goblins, and Bilbo is knocked unconscious. He awakens alone and lost. As he wanders through the underground passages, he finds a ring, and encounters a creature named Gollum (Daran Norris). Gollum makes a deal with Bilbo; they will play a game of riddles. If Gollum wins, he will eat Bilbo, but if Bilbo wins, Gollum will show him the way out. Bilbo wins the game, and Gollum says he must get something before he can lead Bilbo out. He then realizes his ring is gone. Bilbo puts the ring on and discovers it makes its wearer invisible. An infuriated Gollum runs to the exit to try to stop Bilbo leaving, unwittingly leading the invisible Bilbo out. He reunites with the dwarves and Gandalf, but the party are then attacked by a groups of goblins and wargs. They climb to the tops of the trees, and are rescued by a band of eagles, who drop them off near Mirkwood Forest.\n[18600328#2] Gollum - The Ring, which Gollum referred to as \"my precious\" or \"precious\", extended his life far beyond natural limits. Centuries of the Ring's influence twisted Gollum's body and mind, and, by the time of the novels, he \"loved and hated [the Ring], just as he loved and hated himself.\" Throughout the story, Gollum was torn between his lust for the Ring and his desire to be free of it. Bilbo Baggins found the Ring and took it for his own, and Gollum afterwards pursued it for the rest of his life. Gollum finally seized the Ring from Frodo Baggins at the Cracks of Doom in Orodruin in Mordor, but he fell into the fires of the volcano, where both he and the Ring were destroyed.\n[18600328#8] Gollum - In \"The Two Towers\", Frodo and Sam confronted Gollum in the Emyn Muil; Gollum nearly strangled Sam, but Frodo subdued him with his Elvish sword, Sting, which had once belonged to Bilbo. Frodo tied an Elvish rope around Gollum's ankle as a leash, but the mere touch of the rope pained him. Taking pity on the wretched creature, just as Bilbo once had, Frodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore by the \"precious\" itself, and Frodo released him. The unlikely company, guided by Gollum, made their way to the Black Gate, the main entrance to Mordor. Frodo's kindness brought out Gollum's better nature, and he made at least some effort to keep his promise. Sam, however, despised Gollum upon sight, and often warned Frodo of the creature's deception and slipperiness.\n[18600328#11] Gollum - In \"The Return of the King\", Sam single-handedly rescued Frodo from Cirith Ungol and, dressed in scavenged Orc-armour, the two began to make their way across the plateau of Gorgoroth. They finally arrived, against all odds, at Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring could be destroyed. However, Gollum had secretly followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, Gollum attacked them, but Frodo threw him down. Sam faced Gollum on his own, letting Frodo continue up the mountain to finish their mission. Like Bilbo and Frodo before him, Sam spared Gollum's life out of pity, and turned his back on the beaten (but still wily) creature and followed Frodo.\n[22635334#7] The Hunt for Gollum - The scene cuts to Gandalf emerging from Mirkwood's dungeons after interrogating Gollum. Gandalf tells Aragorn that Gollum knows of Bilbo Baggins and The Shire, and explains that he must now go there to warn Frodo. Aragorn suggests sending Frodo to meet him in Bree, and Gandalf readily agrees. The film ends with Gollum speaking to himself in the dungeon, where he vows to kill \"Bagginses\" and reclaim his \"Precious\".\"The Hunt for Gollum\" had a shooting budget of less than £3,000. Location filming took place in North Wales, Epping Forest and Hampstead Heath. 160 people volunteered as crew members for the production. The production design was based on Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\" films. Director Chris Bouchard said, \"Peter Jackson's individual look was a big inspiration, it's been an adventure for us to play in that world that he created.\" The film's most difficult production aspect was the title character.\n[18600328#4] Gollum - Bilbo Baggins stumbled upon Gollum's lair, having found the Ring in the network of goblin tunnels leading down to the lake. At his wits' end in the dark, Bilbo agreed to a riddle game with Gollum on the chance of being shown the way out of the mountains. In the first edition of \"The Hobbit\", Gollum's size is not stated. Only in the revised version is it specified that he is small and is actually an unnaturally long-lived Hobbit. Originally he was also characterized as being less bound to the Ring than in later versions; he offered to give the Ring to Bilbo if he lost the riddle game, and he showed Bilbo the way out of the mountains after losing. To fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien revised later editions of \"The Hobbit\": The version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the Dwarves and Gandalf. In the new version Gollum pretended that he would show Bilbo the way out if he lost the riddle-game, but he actually planned to use the Ring to kill and eat the hobbit. Discovering the Ring missing, he suddenly realized the answer to Bilbo's last riddle – \"What have I got in my pocket?\" – and flew into a rage. Bilbo inadvertently discovered the Ring's power of invisibility as he fled, allowing him to follow Gollum undetected to a back entrance of the caves. Gollum was convinced that Bilbo knew the way out all along, and hoped to intercept him near the entrance, lest the goblins apprehend Bilbo and find the Ring. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum in order to escape, but was overcome with pity, and so merely leaped over him. As Bilbo escaped, Gollum cried out, \"Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!\"\n[36914424#6] The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - The company journeys into the Misty Mountains, where they find themselves amid a colossal battle between Stone Giants. They take refuge in a cave and are captured by Goblins, who take them to their leader, the Great Goblin. Bilbo becomes separated from the Dwarves and falls into a crevice where he encounters Gollum, who unknowingly drops a golden ring. Pocketing the ring, Bilbo finds himself confronted by Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that Bilbo will be shown the way out if he wins or eaten by Gollum if he loses. Bilbo eventually wins by asking Gollum what he has in his pocket. Noticing his ring is lost, Gollum realizes that Bilbo possesses it and chases him. Bilbo discovers that the ring grants him invisibility, but when he has a chance to kill Gollum, Bilbo spares his life out of pity and escapes while Gollum shouts his hatred towards the hobbit Baggins.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The entirety of Community Board 13 had 106,702 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2015 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.7 years. This is near the median life expectancy for New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are adults, with 24% between the ages of 25–44, 27% between 45–64, and 21% who are at least 65 years old. The ratio of young and college-aged residents was lower, at 19% and 8% respectively. Coney Island's elderly population, as a share of the area's total population, is higher than in other New York City neighborhoods.\n[18691665#1] Sanaʽa - Sanaʽa is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. At an elevation of , it is also one of the highest capital cities in the world, and is next to the Sarawat Mountains of Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb and Jabal Tiyal, considered to be the highest mountains in the country and amongst the highest in the region. Sanaʽa has a population of approximately 3,937,500 (2012), making it Yemen's largest city.\n[1729017#2] Demographics of New York City - New York City is the most populous city in the United States, with an estimated 8,491,079 people living in the city, according to U.S. Census estimates dating July 1, 2014 (up from 8,175,133 in 2010; 8.0 million in 2000; and 7.3 million in 1990). This amounts to about 40% of New York State's population and a similar percentage of the metropolitan regional population. New York's two key demographic features are its population density and cultural diversity. The city's population density of 26,403 people per square mile (10,194/km²), makes it the densest of any American municipality with a population above 100,000. Manhattan's population density is 66,940 people per square mile (25,846/km²), highest of any county in the United States.\n[41959688#0] Winfield Toll Bridge - Winfield Toll Bridge, also known as the Ross Booth Memorial Bridge, is a historic three-span cantilever Warren Truss bridge located at Winfield and Red House, Putnam County, West Virginia. It was built in 1955, and spans the Kanawha River, carrying West Virginia Route 34. The cantilever through-truss consists of two anchor spans each 245 feet in length and the main span 462 feet in length between pier center lines. The main span consists of two 128 feet, 4 inch, cantilever arms and a 205 feet, 4 inch, suspended span.\n[1729017#9] Demographics of New York City - New York is the largest city in the United States, with the city proper's population more than double the next largest city, Los Angeles (or roughly equivalent to the combined populations of Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston, the United States' second, third, and fourth most populous cities respectively). Demographers estimate New York's population will reach between 9.4 and 9.7 million by 2030.\nIn 2000 the reported life expectancy of New Yorkers was above the national average. Life expectancy for females born in 2009 in New York City is 80.2 years and for males is 74.5 years.\nNew York's two key demographic features are its density and diversity. The city has an extremely high population density of 26,403 people per square mile (10,194/km²), about 10,000 more people per square mile than the next densest large American city, San Francisco.

There were 484 housing units at an average density of 12.7 per square mile (4.9/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 98.70% White, 0.50% Native American, 0.10% Asian, 0.10% from other races, and 0.60% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.40% of the population.\n[21531764#40] New England - Although a great disparity exists between New England's northern and southern portions, the region's average population density is 234.93 inhabitants/sq mi (90.7/km²). New England has a significantly higher population density than that of the U.S. as a whole (79.56/sq mi), or even just the contiguous 48 states (94.48/sq mi). Three-quarters of the population of New England, and most of the major cities, are in the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. The combined population density of these states is 786.83/sq mi, compared to northern New England's 63.56/sq mi (2000 census).\n[1185547#34] Brownsville, Brooklyn - Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Brownsville was 58,300, a decrease of 799 (1.4%) from the 59,099 counted in 2000.

This goal was achieved in 1989. Puskeppeleit was the first German female doctor to overwinter at the Georg-von-Neumayer Station at Atka Bay (Eckström Shelfeis), Antarctica, during 1989-1991. During this time she was also a member and team leader of the world first female-only team to overwinter in Antarctica. As the first German female station leader, overwintering physician and ship`s doctor onboard SA Agulhas S. A. Agulhas Puskeppeleit substantially contributed to changing the perception of women during the time when Antarctica was a male dominated research area. In 2017 she founded the DocShip International e.V. which should act as an interactive international platform for ship`s doctor. During her overwintering, Puskeppeleit initiated the first polar- and biomedical research at the German Antarctic overwinter station. She started the “UV–B radiation related biological climate change research project” in cooperation with the German Institute for Aero and Space Medicine (DLR). Other pilot-projects like “testing of wind energy plants as an alternative energy source in the Antarctic” or the “Establishment of an alternative waste disposal system at the German Antarctic station” had been also carried out successfully by the female overwintering team. In 1990 as a contemporary witness, Puskeppeleit made in her function as station leader together with the all-female team a unique sociopolitical contribution to the East-West German reunification on the ice. Through regular contact by radio to the former DDR station Georg Forster (70° 46′ S, 11 50 E) for the first time it was possible to information exchange concerning polar research issues. But also in social interaction the all - female team was able to support their East - German overwintering colleagues by German “bridge building” on the ice.\n[51348924#0] Jessie Gellatly - Jessie Handyside Gellatly (7 December 1882 – 30 June 1935) was one of the UK's first university qualified female doctors. She was one of 16 female doctors who served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in the First World War, and served as the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) for Cambridgeshire for most of her life.\n[52130580#0] Sofia Okunevska - Sofia Okunevska (Ukr. Софія Окуневська-Морачевська, Ger. Dr.in Sofia Okunewska-Moraczewska, 12 May 1865, Dovzhanka, Ternopil region, Austrian Empire – 24 February 1926, Lviv, Poland (today Ukraine)) was the first woman who graduated from university and became a doctor in Austria-Hungary, the first Ukrainian female doctor. Okunevska was a public activist and an important figure in feminist movement in Galicia and Austria-Hungary. She also debuted in literature - in the first women's almanac \"First Wreath\" she published a story about urban life \"Sand. Sand! \", as well as work \"Family bondage in songs and wedding ceremonies \". Last years she spent in Lviv, where she led a small medical practice. Okunevska died at the hospital for purulent appendicitis. Buried on Lychakiv Cemetery in Lviv\n[53750692#3] Thirteenth Doctor - The concept of a female Doctor was first mentioned in 1981, when Tom Baker suggested his successor might be female, after announcing the end of his tenure as the Fourth Doctor. Producer John Nathan-Turner later discussed the possibility of casting a woman as the Sixth Doctor to replace the departing Peter Davison's Fifth Doctor, claiming it was feasible but not something he was considering at the moment. In October 1986, during the transmission of Colin Baker's final season as the Sixth Doctor, series creator Sydney Newman wrote to BBC Controller Michael Grade, with a suggestion that \"at a later stage Doctor Who should be metamorphosed into a woman\". Dawn French, Joanna Lumley, and Frances de la Tour were suggested by Newman in 1986 for the role, but were dismissed by the BBC. Lumley later appeared as a satirical version of the Thirteenth Doctor in the 1999 Comic Relief special \"The Curse of Fatal Death\". Arabella Weir also played an alternate Third Doctor in the \"Doctor Who Unbound\" Big Finish episode \"Exile\". Neither portrayal is typically considered to be within the show's main continuity. Producer Jane Tranter also considered casting Judi Dench as the Ninth Doctor. Helen Mirren was suggested for the role of the Twelfth Doctor.\n[2024825#0] Elizabeth Blackwell - Elizabeth Blackwell (February 3, 1821 – May 31, 1910) was a British physician, notable as the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States, and the first woman on the Medical Register of the General Medical Council. Elizabeth Blackwell played an important role in both the United States and the United Kingdom as a social and moral reformer. She acted as a pioneer in promoting the education of women in medicine. Elizabeth Blackwell's contributions remain celebrated through an Elizabeth Blackwell medal that is awarded to one woman every year who has added to the cause of promoting women in medicine. Furthermore, Hobart and William Smith College recently created a statue on their campus honoring Elizabeth Blackwell.\n[34327784#2] Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania - Smedley's \"History of the Underground Railroad\" cites Dr. Bartholomew Fussell with proposing, in 1846, the idea for a college that would train female doctors. It was a tribute to his departed sister, who Bartholomew felt could have been a doctor if women had been given the opportunity at that time. Her daughter, Graceanna Lewis, was to become one of the first woman scientists in the USA. At his house. The Pines, in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, he invited five doctors to carry out his idea. The doctors invited were: Edwin Fussell (Bartholomew's nephew) M.D., Franklin Taylor, M.D., Ellwood Harvey, M.D., Sylvester Birdsall, M.D., and Dr. Ezra Michener. Graceanna was also in attendance. Dr. Fussell would support the college, but had little to do with it after it started in 1850 in Philadelphia.\n[44746202#0] Fanny Jane Butler - Dr. Fanny Jane Butler (5 October 1850 – 26 October 1889) was a medical missionary from England who was among the first female doctors to travel to India and the first fully trained doctor from England to do so. Prior to her work in Kashmir and other parts of India, Butler was a part of the first class of the London School of Medicine for Women, becoming a member of the forefront of female doctors. Butler spent seven years in India until her death in 1889 and opened medical dispensaries in Srinagar and Bhagalpur, where no medical facilities had previously existed. Butler also initiated the building of the first hospital in Srinagar in 1888 called the John Bishop Memorial Hospital and provided necessary medical care for Indian women, for whom little care had been available.\n[49686703#0] Emily Winifred Dickson - Emily Winifred Dickson (13 July 1866 – 19 January 1944) was an Irish doctor who was the first female Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. She was also the first female Fellow of any of the Royal Colleges of Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland.\n[38743812#0] Claudia Potter - Claudia Potter (1881–1970) was the first female anesthesiologist in the United States, as well as the first physician in Texas to use gas anesthesia. She graduated from the University of Texas Medical Branch in 1904. She then did postgraduate work at the Mayo Clinic, served an internship at John Sealy Hospital in Galveston, and entered general practice with another female doctor in San Antonio. In 1906, she was hired by the Temple Sanitarium (later Scott and White Memorial Hospital) as the head of the Department of Anesthesiology, although after hearing of her hiring Dr. Raleigh White wrote to his partner Dr. A.C. Scott, \"I will be home soon, for I know you have lost your mind if you have employed a woman doctor.\"\n[39744823#30] History of women in Puerto Rico - Women's rights, in the early 1900s, opened the doors of opportunity for the women of Puerto Rico making it possible for them to work in positions and professions which were traditionally occupied by men, including the medical profession. The first female medical practitioners in the island were Drs. María Elisa Rivera Díaz and Ana Janer who established their practices in 1909 and Dr. Palmira Gatell who established her practice in 1910. Ana Janer and María Elisa Rivera Díaz graduated in the same medical school class in 1909 and thus could both be considered the first female Puerto Rican physicians. Drs. María Elisa Rivera Díaz, Ana Janer and Palmira Gatell were followed by Dr. Dolores Mercedes Piñero, who earned her medical degree from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Boston in 1913. She was the first Puerto Rican female doctor to serve under contract in the U.S. Army during World War I. During the war, Piñero helped establish a hospital in Puerto Rico which took care of the soldiers who had contracted the swine flu.\n[53847793#0] Bhakti Yadav - Dr. Bhakti Yadav (3 April 1926 – 14 August 2017) was an Indian doctor who was the first female MBBS from Indore, India and she was recognised by being awarded one of India's highest civilian honors, Padma Shri.

    "prompt": "Question: How fast is the fastest firing machine gun?\n\nContexts: [12664#2] General-purpose machine gun - During World War II, the MG 34 was superseded by a new GPMG, the MG 42, although it remained in combat use. The MG 42 was more efficient to manufacture, more robust, and had an extremely high cyclic rate of fire of 1,200 to 1,500 rounds per minute. One of the \"Einheitsmaschinengewehr\" (Universal machine gun) roles was to provide low level anti-aircraft coverage. A high cyclic rate of fire is advantageous for use against targets that are exposed to a general-purpose machine gun for a limited time span, like aircraft or targets that minimize their exposure time by quickly moving from cover to cover. For targets that can be fired on by a general-purpose machine gun for longer periods than just a few seconds the cyclic firing rate becomes less important. Arguably the finest all-round GPMG ever produced, it was nicknamed \"Hitler's buzzsaw\" by troops of Allies, and alongside the MG 34 it inflicted heavy casualties on Allied soldiers on all European and North African front of World War II. Following the end of the war the victorious Allied nations took interest in the MG 34 and MG 42, influencing many post-war general-purpose machine guns, many of which are still in use today. They lent design elements to the Belgian FN MAG and the American M60, while spawning the Zastava M53, Swiss M51, and Austrian MG 74. Such were its qualities of firepower and usability that it became the foundation of an entire series of postwar machine guns, including the MG 1 and MG 3 - the latter is still in production and service to this day.\n[6777103#6] The Fastest Gun Alive - Harold finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church. He sends Swope there to call him out. When the townspeople refuse to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time\", Harold gives an order to Dink to find some kerosene and pour it everywhere. He then instructs Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if their fast gun does not come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town.\n[2642853#153] Institutions in the Southern Victory Series - The Second Great War also saw in use machine guns that closely resemble our timeline's equipment. The Confederate machine gun described as firing so fast it sounded like \"a giant tearing a sail in half\", most definitely points towards the \"Maschinengewehr 42\". The USA appears to have been using .30 caliber air-cooled machine guns resembling the M1919 Browning machine gun. It is also stated that the USA and CSA are equipped with similar .50 caliber pieces that in our timeline can only be the Browning M2. This is odd in that this timeline's John Browning was a Mormon born in Ogden, Utah.\n[239556#16] MG 42 - One of the \"Einheitsmaschinengewehr\" (Universal machine gun) roles was to provide low level anti-aircraft coverage. A high cyclic rate of fire firing rate is advantageous for use against targets that are exposed to a general-purpose machine gun for a limited time span, like aircraft or targets that minimize their exposure time by quickly moving from cover to cover. For targets that can be fired on by a general-purpose machine gun for longer periods than just a few seconds the cyclic firing rate becomes less important. \nAs a consequence one of the MG 42 most notable features was in its high cyclic rate of fire of about 1,200 to 1,500 rounds per minute, twice the rate of the Vickers and Browning machine guns, which fired at a rate of about 600 rounds per minute. The ear could not easily discern the sound of individual shots being fired, instead hearing a sound described as like \"ripping cloth\" or a buzzsaw.\n[1286978#9] Rate of fire - This is the mechanical rate of fire, or how fast the weapon \"cycles\" (loads, locks, fires, unlocks, ejects). Measurement of the cyclic rate assumes that the weapon is being operated as fast as possible and does not consider operator tasks (magazine changes, aiming, etc.). When the trigger is pulled, the rate at which rounds are fired is the cyclic rate. Typical cyclic rates of fire are 600–900 RPM for assault rifles, 1,000-1,100 RPM in some cases, 900-1,200 RPM for submachine guns and machine pistols, and 600-1,500 RPM for machine guns. M134 Miniguns mounted on attack helicopters and other combat vehicles can achieve rates of fire of over 100 rounds per second (6,000 RPM). Cyclic rate of fire is the only rate that can be determined precisely.\n[12560596#3] Breda M37 - In service, the Breda 37 and 38 proved to be fairly reliable heavy machine guns. Perhaps because the heavy support weapons received more attention from their crews, field reports were generally positive except for jams caused by desert sand and dust, which in the Western Desert affected all infantry machine guns to some extent. The Breda 37's slow rate of fire helped prevent overheating during continuous fire, and its powerful, heavy-bullet cartridge had excellent range and penetration. Still, this machine gun was almost twice as heavy as the German machine guns and heavier than weapons like the M1919. In fact, it was the heaviest World War II 'light' machine gun, and unnecessarily complex to use and deploy. This was another issue for Italians, whose mobility was limited by their weak truck fleet. The tripod added around 20 kg to the complex, putting it at around 40 kilograms.\n[2150860#8] Fast draw - The exhibition shooter Bob Munden (1942-2012), self-proclaimed as the \"fastest man with a gun ever\", could draw, fire, break a balloon target with a blank using a standard weight single-action revolver and return his gun to his holster in the blink of an eye. On the DVD \"Outrageous Shooting,\" Munden was filmed shooting .16 of a second in an event called Walk and Draw Level.\n[2938362#10] ShKAS machine gun - The ShKAS was the fastest-firing rifle calibre aircraft armament in general service in World War II. A one-second burst from the four ShKAS of a Polikarpov I-153 or Polikarpov I-16 placed 120 bullets within 15 angular mils at 400 meters (1,312 feet) giving a firing density of 5 bullets per square meter of the sky. Moreover, the ShKAS was unusually light as well; the four guns, with 650 rounds of ammunition each, weighed a total of only 160 kg (350 lb).\nShKAS wasn't problem-free though. Soviet machine-gun technician Viktor M. Sinaisky recalled:Although chambered in the 7.62×54mmR, the ShKAS guns used cartridges specially built for them to smaller tolerances; to distinguish them from the regular 7.62 ammunition, the Cyrillic letter \"Sh\" (Ш) was imprinted on the bottom of the cases. The cases, designed by N. M. Elizarov, also had a few additional features like double crimping and a thicker case wall of \"bimetallic\" construction instead of the traditional brass. The main type of bullet used was armour-piercing incendiary B-32 bullet.Some military historians consider that feed system of the Mauser MG 213C (the seminal revolver cannon for Western designs) was inspired by the ShKAS.\n[2150860#6] Fast draw - Fast draw is one of the fastest sports in the world. Every time is measured under one second, from the signal to draw to when the timer is stopped. The current World Fast Draw Association (WFDA) record for Open Class Fast Draw in an event called Standing Balloons is .208 seconds - and that includes the time it takes to react, draw, fire and pop a balloon target at eight feet away. A world class competitor can draw and fire a shot in under half a second. Given that the average human reaction time is around 0.2 to 0.25 seconds, the round is over before most people can react. The reaction times of the best fast draw shooters is 0.145 seconds, which means that the gun is cocked, drawn, aimed (from the hip), and fired in just over 0.06 seconds. To establish a World Fast Draw Association record, a second shot must be fired in the same competition that is no more than 0.30 seconds slower than the first; this is intended to prevent a shot that anticipates the start signal from setting a record. In competitions where two rounds must be fired, at separate targets, less than 0.10 seconds separate the shots.\n[1862461#7] Heavy machine gun - Machine guns diverged into heavier and lighter designs. The later model water-cooled Maxim guns and its derivatives the MG 08 and the Vickers, as well as the American M1917 Browning machine gun, were all substantial weapons. The .303 Vickers, for example, weighed 33 lb (15 kg) and was mounted on a tripod that brought the total weight to 50 lb (23 kg). The heavier designs could, and in some cases did, fire for days on end, mainly in fixed defensive positions to repel infantry attacks. These machine guns were typically mounted on tripods and were water-cooled, and a well-trained crew could fire nonstop for hours, given sufficient ammunition, replacement barrels and cooling water. Carefully positioned heavy machine guns could stop an attacking force before they reached their objectives.\n[41764578#1] 82nd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion - The battalion mainly used the M-8 Light Armored Car, as it was fast, up to 56 mph (90 km/h), and gave some protection from small arms fire. M8 was equipped with a 37 mm gun and 6X6 wheel drive. The M8 was the main reconnaissance vehicle used by the US military in World War II. Also used was M20 scout car, which was a M-8 without the 37 mm gun and turret. In its place was an anti-aircraft ring mount for a .50-caliber machine gun. A bazooka was provided for the crew to compensate for its lack of anti-armor weaponry. With this vehicles, the 82nd could scout ahead of the slower M4 Sherman tank with a top speed of 25 mph to 30 mph. Also used for reconnaissance and to run messages Harley-Davidson WLA motorcycles were used by the 82nd as well. Almost all units used Jeeps as they were fast four-wheel drive utility vehicles.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

Brailsford estimated in 1906 that two-thirds of the population of Kosovo was Albanian and one-third Serbian. The most populous western districts of Gjakova and Peć were said to have between 20,000 and 25,000 Albanian households, as against some 5,000 Serbian ones. A map of Alfred Stead, published in 1909, shows that similar numbers of Serbs and Albanians were living in the territory.\n[42026705#31] Old Bazaar, Gjakova - According to some statistics in the early 20th century in Gjakova there were 400 craftsmen. The vigorous development of craftsmanship stimulated also the development of trade. \"The people of Gjakova have a tendency agriculture, but they are more betrothed to trade. They go to distant places where they open their shops, inns etc. to provide for their living\" was written in the yearbook (salname) of the vilayet of Kosova in 1887. The Gjakovar traders and craftsmen used to sell their product not only in Grand Bazaar, but also in many markets in other towns of Ottoman Empire, of Serbia and Austria. According to the facts, in the 1720s, the traders of Pristina and Gjakova transported their goods firstly to Dubrovnik and then to Italy. In 1803 the trader (merchant) from Gjakova, Jonuz Spahiu, had sold 114 bales of small leathers in Venice. In 1827 Salih Gjakova and Kërsto Gjakova sent gunpowder, rifles and flint stone to Sarajevo, whilst a year later, Hasan Gjakova and his nephew Hamza sent three bales of rifles to Serbia. According to the minutes of customs duty (cymryks) of Pozhega, of Aleksinac, of Kragujevac, of Mokra Gora, of Belgrade, etc., the traders from Gjakova sold their goods such as silk galloons, tobacco, rice, maize, eels, razors, soles, double-barrel sporting rifles, pistols, long rifles, cartridges, gunpowder, flint stones, wax, snuff, different leathers, salt, oil, cotton, cotton breast collars, cotton ribbons, silver galloons, scarfs, figs etc. Ali Sulejmani from Gjakova, in 1837, transported 56 loads of sheep leathers and other goods in an amount of 283.38 groshes, through Belgrade to Austria whereas in 1841, Halil Dobruna transported through Serbia to Austria galloons in an amount of 1800 groshes and 21,5 loads of Morocco leather (saftjan).\n[283887#0] Gjakova - Gjakova () or Đakovica (; sometimes transliterated as Djakovica) is a city and municipality located in the Gjakova District of western Kosovo. According to the 2011 census, the city of Gjakova has 40,827 inhabitants, while the municipality has,94,556 inhabitants.\n[283887#24] Gjakova - According to official data, in 2006, there were 581 registered small and medium enterprises, in 2008 there were 3,120 such registered businesses, while in 2012 their number had reached 4,120. Gjakova currently has 12,000 people employed, in both the public and private sector, mostly in the latter. Although unemployment is high, there is a gradual increase of employment over the years according to data from the Kosovo Ministry of Work and Social Wellbeing. According to government statistics, in 2010, 40,000 people were registered as unemployed, while in 2011 this number decreased to 30,000 and in 2012 to 15,000. 30,000 people in Gjakova receive social assistance. This category includes poor families, people with disabilities, families of war veterans/victims and the retired.\n[283887#23] Gjakova - According to official sources identified in the Ministry of Trade and Industry, by the end of 2005 there were about 3,200 registered businesses that exercise activity in different areas of Gjakova, such as enterprise manufacturing, construction, service, trade, catering, craft, transportation, information technology, etc. Social economy in 1989 has counted 45 companies that have employed 18,640 workers. In non-economic activities (education, health, culture, government institutions, banks, etc.) there were employed 4000 workers. Furthermore, they also developed the private economy – where in 2010 approximately 920 employees were registered in the business entities. The economy of the municipality of Gjakova suffered mostly during the economic sanctions and the mass violence done by Serbian forces during the war. The situation further during NATO’s intervention as a result of the destructive actions of multiple military and police forces, which have stood and operated in the economic enterprise facilities. This meant that during their withdrawal, these Serbian forces robbed, looted and destroyed most of the assets, inventories, transportation machines, etc. The losses that were done in the social economy as a result of the war were approximately 190 million DEM, whereas in the private economy around 100 million DEM.\n[283887#31] Gjakova - Historical monuments in Gjakova are divided into three main categories based on their cultural, religious and social context. The core part of the town was created between the Krena River to the east and Cabrati hill to the west. Around the cornerstone of the town, the Old Bazaar - the center of trade and craftsmanship - was created. By 1900, the bazaar housed around 1000 enterprises. Numerous bridges were built to enable the journey of trade caravans across the neighboring rivers. With the fast development of trade in the city, several inns were built to host the many visitors. Because of its ancient origins and fast economic development, Gjakova has become of great historical importance.\n[283887#27] Gjakova - Dominated by small family businesses, retail stores, cafeterias and providers of basic services, the private sector of Gjakova remains weak. It makes up only 5.5 percent of all businesses registered in Kosovo. According to the Tax Administration Office in Gjakova, 88 to 93 percent of active businesses are businesses with a single owner, five to ten percent are businesses with limited liability and the remaining two percent are large businesses. As in any other place in Kosovo, more than 90 percent of the sector consists of small family businesses which cannot create growth with added value. Only 2 out of 53 studied businesses in the centre of Gjakova declared not having employed any relative.\n[283887#13] Gjakova - According to the 2011 census, the resident population was 94,556, of which urban inhabitants numbered 40,827 and rural 53,729; there were 47,226 males and 47,330 females.

The book \"Estudio histórico de la migración judía a México 1900-1950\" has records of almost 18,300 who emigrated to Mexico between 1900 and 1950. Most (7,023) were Ashkenazi Jews whose ancestors had settled in Eastern Europe, mainly Poland. A further 2,640 Jews arrived from either Spain or the Ottoman Empire and 1,619 came from Cuba and the United States.\n[38380347#8] Holy Week in Mexico - The most famous passion play in Mexico is held in Iztapalapa in the east of Mexico City. This production involves over 4000 local residents (all of which are born in Iztapalapa) which perform scenes related to the last week of Jesus’s life from Palm Sunday to Good Friday. The production has been done each year since 1843 and today the spectacle attracts over 2 million spectators, mostly Mexican. The play is not a strictly Biblical production as there are a number of characters such as a spy, a dog, a “wandering Jew” and others that are unique to this event. When Christ is captured, Aztec drums and flutes are played. Pontius Pilate sentences Jesus on the town of Iztapalapa’s main square then whipped. He then carries a cross from this square to the Cerro de la Estrella on a route over mile long through eight of the borough’s oldest neighborhoods. The most important event is the procession with the cross and the crucifixion scene portrayed on Cerro de la Estrella. Many others called “Nazarenes” follow, carrying their own crosses and wearing real crowns of thorns like Jesus. The play ends with Judas hanging himself after the crucifixion.\n[3966054#145] Mexico - The presence of Jews in Mexico dates back to 1521, when Hernán Cortés conquered the Aztecs, accompanied by several Conversos. According to the 2010 census, there are 67,476 Jews in Mexico. Islam in Mexico is practiced mostly by Arab Mexicans. In the 2010 census 18,185 Mexicans reported belonging to an Eastern religion, a category which includes a tiny Buddhist population.\n[30249820#5] Human trafficking in Mexico - Mexico is one of the global centers of the child prostitution trade and a source and transit country for large numbers of migrants moving northward from Central America. There are an estimated 16,000 to 20,000 Mexican and Central American children who are trafficked for sex in Mexico. However, data on the number of victims of labor trafficking are not available. Additionally, the number of people trafficking into the United States from Mexico is known to vary widely, as do estimates of how many trafficking victims make such crossings.\n[10716868#10] History of the Jews in Mexico - In 1900, the Mexican census counted 134 Jews in the country. From then until 1950, an estimated 7,300 Jewish people immigrated to Mexico from Eastern Europe, 2,640 from Spain or the former Ottoman Empire, and 1,620 from Cuba and the United States. These various Jewish groups formed their own religious congregations and social institutions. Turkish Jews began holding open religious services in 1901 and founded the first Talmud Torah in 1905, as an educational institution for boys. Ashkenazi Jews began holding open services as early as 1904. The first formal Jewish organization in Mexico, the Monte Sinaí community was founded in 1912.\nDuring the Mexican Revolution many foreigners, including Jews, left the country but immediately after Jews began to arrive again in substantial numbers again. Between 1917 and 1920 they began to come from Russia, Poland, Lithuania, the Balkans and the Middle East. The rate increased in 1921 when the United States imposed quotas on its immigration. Ten thousand arrived from Eastern Europe to the port of Veracruz at the invitation of President Plutarco Elías Calles. Jewish organizations such as the Comité de Damas and North American B'nai B'rith were formed to help the new arrivals adapt. In the 1920s, the Jewish community grew and prospered in Mexico. The immigration rate slowed after 1929 because of the Great Depression and new immigration policies which favored those with a more similar ethnic and religious background to that of Mexico.\n[10716868#24] History of the Jews in Mexico - The Mexican Inquisition succeeded in eliminating all vestiges of open Judaism in Mexico but there are an estimated 20,000 Mexicans with Jewish ancestry. While the Crypto-Jews were assimilated into the general populace, there are families in Mexico and the southwest United States that practice what appear to be Jewish rituals and customs, knowing or not knowing where these come from. For those claiming Crypto-Jewish heritage one or more of three lines of evidence are usually presented: the existence of Jewish rituals in the family, the existence of Inquisition records with Jewish family names and the oral history of the family. It also generally includes strong secrecy about family history and rituals. For some descendants, the discovery of Crypto-Jewish heritage leads them to reclaiming all or some of the Sephardic Jewish faith, often by adopting a number of rituals and customs.\n[10716868#16] History of the Jews in Mexico - The current Jewish population in Mexico mostly consists of those who have descended from immigrants from the 19th and early 20th centuries with nationwide totals estimated between 40,000 and 50,000, about 75% of whom are in Mexico City. The exact numbers are not known. One main source for figures is the Comité Central Israelita in Mexico City but its contact is limited to Orthodox and Conservative congregations with no contact with Jews that may be affiliated with the Reform movement or those who consider themselves secular. The Mexican government census lists religion but its categories are confusing, confusing those of some Protestant sects which practice Judaic rituals with Jewish groups. There is also controversy as to whether to count those Crypto-Jews who have converted (back) to Judaism. Sixty two percent of the population over fifteen is married, three percent divorced and four percent widowed. However, younger Jewish women are more likely to be employed outside the home (only 18% of women are housewives) and fertility rates are dropping from 3.5 children of women over 65 to 2.7 for the overall population now. There is a low level of intermarriage with the general Mexican population, with only 3.1% of marriages being mixed. Although the Jewish community is less than one percent of Mexico’s total population, Mexico is one of the few countries whose Jewish population is expected to grow.\nThe Mexican Jewish community has strong roots in Mexico and has few problems in its host country. Openly Jewish people serve prominently in government positions and are found in most spheres of Mexico’s business, intellectual and artistic communities. One U.S. born Jew by the name of Sidney Franklin became a popular bullfighter in the early 1920s. There are occasional clashes between the Jewish community and others in Mexico but these are generally solved peacefully. There is an Interfaith Council to help with these issues. While the Catholic Church is dominant both religiously and culturally, it does not suppress the worship or other activities of other religious groups. The only challenges the community faces are intermarriage and migration out of the country. However, Latin American popular culture can resent apparent Jewish economic success, with the community associated with international capital and international influence.\n[34343155#18] Hispanos of New Mexico - According to the \"Kupersmit Research\", in 2015 there were about 24,000 Jews in New Mexico, 1,700 of which were born in the state. Some researchers and historians believe that number would rise considerably if Anusim (or Crypto-Jews) were included in those estimates.\n[10716868#12] History of the Jews in Mexico - The Jewish population in Mexico was estimated at 21,000 in 1930. From then until the 1940s, the Jews that arrived were those fleeing the Nazis but this immigration was not as large as in previous decades as most of those who arrived where those who already had family and friends in the country.\n[1040159#106] Who is a Jew? - A genetic study of men in the early 2000s showed that many Hispanos of the American Southwest are descended from Anusim (Sephardic Jews who were forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism). Only Catholic Spanish were allowed to go to the New World with the exploration and colonial expeditions. Families first kept their secrets for protection and then out of habit. Michael Hammer, a research professor at the University of Arizona and an expert on Jewish genetics, said that fewer than 1% of non-Semites possessed the male-specific \"Cohanim marker\" or Cohen Modal Haplotype, which is prevalent among Jews claiming descent from hereditary priests. 30 of 78 Latinos tested in New Mexico (38.5%), were found to have Y-DNA with the Cohanim marker. Wider DNA testing of Hispanic populations has revealed between 10% and 15% of men living in New Mexico, south Texas and northern Mexico have a Y chromosome associated with the Middle East. Their history makes it most likely that they are Jewish rather than Arabic Muslim.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

From 2008 to 2009 Turner was the series producer of the British television soap opera \"Emmerdale\".\nTurner worked as a script editor for the ITV series \"Emmerdale\", and held that role for three years.\n[4118084#12] Paul Lambert (Emmerdale) - On 3 March 2008, Paul and Jonny made British television history by becoming the first couple on a primetime soap opera to enter a civil partnership since the Civil Partnership Act 2004 came into force on 5 December 2005. Although radio soap \"The Archers\" and daytime soap \"Doctors\" had previously featured civil partnerships, \"Emmerdale\" was the first primetime soap opera to do so. Bose said he was proud \"Emmerdale\" was the first, and commented that soaps \"have a great responsibility to show things as they change and be cutting edge\".\n[49387526#0] Kate Oates - Kate Oates (born 1979/1980) is a British television producer, known for her work on the soap operas \"The Archers\", \"Emmerdale\", \"Coronation Street\" and \"EastEnders\".\n[192572#0] Emmerdale - Emmerdale (known as Emmerdale Farm until 1989) is a British soap opera set in Emmerdale (known as Beckindale until 1994), a fictional village in the Yorkshire Dales. Created by Kevin Laffan, \"Emmerdale Farm\" was first broadcast on 16 October 1972. Produced by ITV Yorkshire, it has been filmed at their Leeds studio since its inception. The programme is broadcast in every ITV region.\n[49387526#9] Kate Oates - Oates' appointment as the series producer of \"Coronation Street\", succeeding Blackburn, was announced on 18 September 2015. Oates was delighted to join the soap, describing the move as \"exiciting\" and adding that she felt honoured to do so. Oates joined the soap in early 2016. On the move from \"Emmerdale\" to \"Coronation Street\", she commented, \"But as much as \"Emmerdale\" has meant the world to me \"Corrie\" also has a special place in my heart.\" John Whiston felt that Oates was the perfect person to become the series producer of the soap. Blackburn described the position as \"one of the best jobs in television\" and wished Oates luck. Roberts opined that Oates would make an \"ideal\" producer for the series and believed that she had \"all the qualities to be a big success as producer of \"Coronation Street\"\". Mark Jefferies of \"Daily Mirror\" thought that Oates would be the \"\"Coronation Street\" saviour\". Oates was first credited in the position in episode 8968, first broadcast on 15 August 2016.\n[5245149#0] Oliver Horsbrugh - Oliver Horsbrugh (1937 – August 2009) was a British television director most recently for \"Emmerdale\". He also directed episodes of the top rated ITV1 soap opera, \"Coronation Street\", from the early 1970s. He won a BAFTA as part of the \"Emmerdale\" team in 2001 when the programme was awarded the Best Soap Award.\n[192572#4] Emmerdale - The premise of \"Emmerdale Farm\" was similar to the BBC radio soap opera \"The Archers\", focusing on a family, a farm and characters in a nearby village. The programme's farmyard filming was originally modelled on RTÉ's \"The Riordans\", an Irish soap opera which was broadcast from the mid-1960s to the end of the 1970s. \"The Riordans\" broke new ground for soap operas by being filmed largely outdoors (on a farm, owned on the programme by Tom and Mary Riordan) rather than in a studio—the usual practice of British and American soap operas. The programme pioneered farmyard location shooting, with farm animals and equipment. During the 1960s and 1970s, outdoor filming of television programmes with outdoor broadcast units (OBUs) was in its infancy due to higher costs and reliance on the weather. \"The Riordans\" success demonstrated that a soap opera could be filmed largely outdoors, and Yorkshire Television sent people to its set in County Meath to see the programme's production firsthand.\n[49387526#3] Kate Oates - Oates began working on the ITV soap opera \"Emmerdale\" in early 2010 as a story editor, under then-producer, Gavin Blyth. Oates edited various storylines for the show, including Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) assisting the suicide of his boyfriend, Jackson Walsh (Marc Silcock), which won the British Soap Award for Best Storyline in 2012. Oates held a key role in the soap's fortieth anniversary celebrations and said that she was \"proud\" to be involved. Oates left her position at \"Emmerdale\" in 2012, having worked on the show for two and a half years. Reflecting on Oates' work on the show as story editor, John Whiston, the creative director of ITV soaps, commented, \"Kate swept into Emmerdale a couple of years ago with a deadly combination of determination and brio. She soon proved her worth to the show, working on stories that ranged from the extremely tough to the light and funny.\"\n[49387526#15] Kate Oates - Andy Halls of \"The Sun\" reported on 22 July 2018 that Oates had entered negotiations with the BBC to become the executive producer of their soap opera, \"EastEnders\". A BBC spokesperson told Halls that producers liked her work on \"Coronation Street\" and felt it would suit the tone of \"EastEnders\". Over two weeks later, it was announced that Oates would become the senior executive producer of \"EastEnders\" as well as BBC medical dramas \"Casualty\" and \"Holby City\". Oates will primarily work with the team at \"EastEnders\" and will work alongside the show's current executive consultant, John Yorke from October to December 2018 to provide a \"smooth handover\". Afterwards, Oates will have sole responsibility for the show. Oates relished in the chance to be involved in the production of the three shows. She commented, \"I'm excited about meeting the teams and talent behind each show and can't wait to get stuck in and tell some unmissable stories.\" Mark Linsey, the CCO of BBC Studios, called Oates a \"dynamic, passionate and creative storyteller\" and looked forward to her joining the studios. Charlotte Moore was very pleased with Oates' appointment and said in a press release, \"she has a real passion for soaps and I have no doubt that her experience, creative flair and dynamism will excite the next generation of BBC One soap fans.\" Piers Wenger, the controller of BBC Drama, opined that Oates had an \"unrivalled\" ability to make soaps and continuing dramas popular and \"talked about\". He predicted that she would be \"brilliant\" in her new position.\n[4118084#0] Paul Lambert (Emmerdale) - Paul Lambert is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, \"Emmerdale\", played by Mathew Bose. Paul appeared between 2004 and 2009. He arrives as the son of existing characters Val Lambert (Charlie Hardwick) and Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) and in 2008 Paul, who is openly gay, enters into a civil partnership with Jonny Foster, the first of any primetime soap opera. In 2015, Bose made brief returns to the show, on two separate occasions, one being in March and the other being in September.\n[9204734#7] Jonny Foster - On 3 March 2008, Paul and Jonny made British television history by becoming the first couple on a primetime soap opera to enter a civil partnership since the Civil Partnership Act 2004 came into force on 5 December 2005. Although radio soap \"The Archers\" and daytime soap \"Doctors\" had previously featured civil partnerships, \"Emmerdale\" was the first primetime soap opera to do so.

    "prompt": "Question: How many Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps?\n\nContexts: [2303855#19] Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses - About 10,000 Witnesses were imprisoned, including 2000 sent to concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles; as many as 1200 died, including 250 who were executed. From 1935 Gestapo officers offered members a document to sign indicating renouncement of their faith, submission to state authority, and support of the German military. Historian Detlef Garbe says a \"relatively high number\" of people signed the statement before the war, but \"extremely low numbers\" of Bible Student prisoners did so in concentration camps in later years.\n[355852#12] Dachau concentration camp - Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, and emigrants were sent to Dachau after the 1935 passage of the Nuremberg Laws which institutionalized racial discrimination. In early 1937, the SS, using prisoner labor, initiated construction of a large complex capable of holding 6,000 prisoners. The construction was officially completed in mid-August 1938. More political opponents, and over 11,000 German and Austrian Jews were sent to the camp after the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland in 1938. Sinti and Roma in the hundreds were sent to the camp in 1939, and over 13,000 prisoners were sent to the camp from Poland in 1940.\nThe prisoners of Dachau concentration camp originally were to serve as forced labor for a munition factory, and to expand the camp. It was used as a training center for SS guards and was a model for other concentration camps. The camp was about in rectangular shape. The prisoners' entrance was secured by an iron gate with the motto \"Arbeit macht frei\" (\"Work will make you free\"). This reflected Nazi propaganda, which trivialized concentration camps as labor and re-education camps, when in fact forced labor was used as a method of torture and murder.\n[25074#92] Persecution of Christians - Outside mainstream Christianity, the Jehovah's Witnesses were targets of Nazi Persecution, for their refusal to swear allegiance to the Nazi government. In Nazi Germany in the 1930s and early 1940s, Jehovah's Witnesses refused to renounce their political neutrality and they were placed in concentration camps as a result. The Nazi government gave detained Jehovah's Witnesses the option of release if they signed a document which indicated their renouncement of their faith, their submission to state authority, and their support of the German military. Historian Hans Hesse said, \"Some five thousand Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps where they alone were 'voluntary prisoners', so termed because the moment they recanted their views, they could be freed. Some lost their lives in the camps, but few renounced their faith\".\n[13949533#0] Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany - Jehovah's Witnesses suffered religious persecution in Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1945 after refusing to perform military service, join Nazi organizations or give allegiance to the Hitler regime. An estimated 10,000 Witnesses—half of the number of members in Germany during that period—were imprisoned, including 2000 who were sent to Nazi concentration camps. An estimated 1200 died in custody, including 250 who were executed. They were the first Christian denomination banned by the Nazi government and the most extensively and intensively persecuted.\n[13949533#21] Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany - From 1935, the authorities began sending hundreds of Jehovah's Witnesses to concentration camps, where they were imprisoned with Communists, Socialists, other political prisoners and union members. In May 1938, they accounted for 12 percent of all prisoners at Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar; by May 1939, they represented 40 percent of all prisoners at Schloss Lichentenburg, the central concentration camp for women, though as the total number of prisoners increased rapidly, the proportion of Witnesses generally fell to about 3 percent. About 2000 Witnesses were eventually sent to Nazi concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles; as many as 1200 died in custody, including 250 who were executed. Garbe claims members of the group were special objects of hatred by the SS, receiving beatings, whippings and public humiliation and given the dirtiest and most laborious work details for refusing to salute, stand at attention or sing Nazi songs. They were subjected to high-pressure jets of ice-cold water from fire hydrants and subjected to arbitrary acts of torture, including pushing a fully laden wheelbarrow with their necks while crawling on hands and knees. Others were forced to stand still for an entire day in the heat or cold, or were confined in groups in small closets in an attempt to suffocate them. From March to December 1938, Jehovah's Witnesses in Buchenwald were not allowed to send or receive letters or to purchase food. Many approached starvation and were forced to eat leaves from trees and bushes. Many were forced to engage in a \"drill\" that included rolling, creeping, hopping, and running for 75 minutes while camp guards kicked and beat them, while others, forced to work in stone quarries, were refused medical attention when sick. Despite persecution, Jehovah's Witnesses continued to hold secret religious gatherings inside the camps.\n[10396793#88] The Holocaust - Because they refused to pledge allegiance to the Nazi party or to serve in the military, Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps where they were given the option of renouncing their faith and submitting to the state's authority. They were marked out by purple triangles. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum estimates between 2,700 and 3,300 were sent to concentration camps, but Sybil Milton states the number in the camps was 10,000. Between 1,400 and 2,500 died while in the camps. Historian Detlef Garbe writes that \"no other religious movement resisted the pressure to conform to National Socialism with comparable unanimity and steadfastness.\"\n[5893436#7] Amersfoort concentration camp - The fluctuating prisoner population showed an eclectic group of people from all over the Netherlands: Jews, Jehovah's Witnesses, prisoners of war from the Soviet Union, members of the resistance, clergy, black marketeers, clandestine butchers and smugglers. From 1941–1943, 8,800 people were imprisoned in the camp, of which 2,200 were deported to Germany. During the period 1943–1945, 26,500 people were imprisoned, of which 18,000 were sent east to places like Buchenwald and Natzweiler concentration camps.\n[2303855#40] Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses - Jehovah's Witnesses did not have a significant presence in the Soviet Union prior to 1939 when the Soviet Union forcibly incorporated eastern Poland, Moldavia, and Lithuania, each of which had a Jehovah's Witness movement. Although never large in number (estimated by the KGB to be 20,000 in 1968), the Jehovah's Witnesses became one of the most persecuted religious groups in the Soviet Union during the post-World War II era. Members were arrested or deported; some were put in Soviet concentration camps. Witnesses in Moldavian SSR were deported to Tomsk Oblast; members from other regions of the Soviet Union were deported to Irkutsk Oblast. KGB officials, who were tasked with dissolving the Jehovah's Witness movement, were disturbed to discover that the Witnesses continued to practice their faith even within the labor camps.\n[15430106#2] Niederhagen concentration camp - A move to a newly built camp in the Niederhagen suburb of Wewelsburg followed. In September 1941, when the camp became an independent concentration camp under the name Niederhagen concentration camp, 480 prisoners were interned there. From 1941, more and more prisoners from outside Germany were imprisoned in the camp.\nThe approximately 3,900 prisoners included Jehovah's Witnesses, political prisoners, Sinti and Romani people, Yeniche, homosexuals, Jews, prisoners of war and forced laborers from Poland, the Soviet Union (also prisoners of war), Czechoslovakia, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. Almost a third of them did not survive their imprisonment. The deaths of 1,285 prisoners are recorded. They died of hunger, cold, disease and the consequences of ill-treatment. In 1942, a crematorium was built specifically for the camp. The Gestapo also used the camp as a place for executions. A total of 56 people from Westphalia-Lippe, including women and children, were executed there on the orders of Heinrich Himmler. In the period from 1 September 1941 to 1 May 1943, the camp was an independent concentration camp. Before, it had been a satellite camp first of the Sachsenhausen and then of the Buchenwald concentration camp. From 1943, only 50 people were imprisoned at Niederhagen, and on 2 April 1945, the prisoners were ordered to be executed, but the SS officer ordered to tell a couple of guards to kill them, said that he would do it himself and once all of the others retreated he told all of the Jehovah's Witnesses that they were free (and he is now a Jehovah's Witness himself), and they were liberated by the American army. Very little is left of the camp. Today, the former camp kitchen houses the local fire station of the volunteer fire department and some apartments, the gatehouse is now a two-family house, while a residential estate was built over the rest of the former camp.\n[4080979#44] Religion in Nazi Germany - Jehovah's Witnesses or \"Bible Researchers\" (Bibelforschers) as they were known in Germany, comprised 25,000 members and they were among those persecuted by the Nazi government. All incarcerated members were identified by a unique purple triangle. Some members of the religious group refused to serve in the German military or give allegiance to the Nazi government, for which 250 were executed. An estimated 10,000 were arrested for various crimes, and 2,000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps, where approximately 1,200 were killed. Jehovah's Witnesses were among the few who could leave the concentration camps simply by signing a document renouncing their religious beliefs.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What's the chemical compound of salt?\n\nContexts: [1605200#0] Salt - Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite. Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater, where it is the main mineral constituent. The open ocean has about of solids per liter of sea water, a salinity of 3.5%.\n[1555251#0] History of salt - Salt, also referred to as table salt or by its chemical formula NaCl, is an ionic compound made of sodium and chloride ions. All life has evolved to depend on its chemical properties to survive. It has been used by humans for thousands of years, from food preservation to seasoning. Salt's ability to preserve food was a founding contributor to the development of civilization. It helped to eliminate dependence on seasonal availability of food, and made it possible to transport food over large distances. However, salt was often difficult to obtain, so it was a highly valued trade item, and was considered a form of currency by certain peoples. Many salt roads, such as the via Salaria in Italy, had been established by the Bronze age.\n[4047274#0] Gold salts - Gold salts are ionic chemical compounds of gold. The term, a misnomer, is a synonym for the gold compounds used in medicine. \"Chrysotherapy\" and \"aurotherapy\" are the applications of gold compounds to medicine. Contemporary research on the effect of gold salts treatment began in 1935, primarily to reduce inflammation and to slow disease progression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The use of gold compounds has decreased since the 1980s because of numerous side effects and monitoring requirements, limited efficacy, and very slow onset of action. Most chemical compounds of gold, including some of the drugs discussed below, are not salts, but are examples of metal thiolate complexes.\n[27558#11] Salt (chemistry) - Common salt-forming cations include:Common salt-forming anions (parent acids in parentheses where available) include:Salts with varying number of hydrogen atoms, with respect to the parent acid, replaced by cations can be referred to as \"monobasic\", \"dibasic\" or \"tribasic\" salts (\"polybasic\" salts refer to those with more than one hydrogen atom replaced):Salts are formed by a chemical reaction between:Strong salts or strong electrolyte salts are chemical salts composed of strong electrolytes. These ionic compounds dissociate completely in water. They are generally odourless and nonvolatile.\n[4240179#0] Reinecke's salt - Reinecke's salt is a chemical compound with the formula NH[Cr(NCS)(NH)]·HO. The dark-red crystalline compound is soluble in boiling water, acetone, and ethanol. The chromium atom is surrounded by six nitrogen atoms in an octahedral geometry. The NH ligands are mutually \"trans\" and the Cr–NCS groups are linear. The salt crystallizes with one molecule of water.\n[15939727#0] Roussin's black salt - Roussin's black salt is a chemical compound with the formula NaFeS(NO) first described by Zacharie Roussin. It consists of the sodium salt of the [FeS(NO)] anion and is classified as metal nitrosyl compound. The cluster anion has the geometry of an incomplete cubane-type cluster with \"C\" symmetry. The dark colour of the complex is attributed to a number of charge-transfer interactions.\n[80207#0] Sodium chloride - Sodium chloride , also known as salt (though sea salt also contains other chemical salts), is an ionic compound with the chemical formula NaCl, representing a 1:1 ratio of sodium and chloride ions. With molar masses of 22.99 and 35.45 g/mol respectively, 100 g of NaCl contains 39.34 g Na and 60.66 g Cl. Sodium chloride is the salt most responsible for the salinity of seawater and of the extracellular fluid of many multicellular organisms. In its edible form of table salt, it is commonly used as a condiment and food preservative. Large quantities of sodium chloride are used in many industrial processes, and it is a major source of sodium and chlorine compounds used as feedstocks for further chemical syntheses. A second major application of sodium chloride is de-icing of roadways in sub-freezing weather.\n[2531152#0] Diazonium compound - Diazonium compounds or diazonium salts are a group of organic compounds sharing a common functional group where R can be any organic group, such as an alkyl or an aryl, and X is an inorganic or organic anion, such as a halogen. Alkyldiazonium compounds are generally unstable and nonisolable, due to the extreme leaving group ability of N in S1/E1 (secondary and tertiary alkyldiazonium salts) or S2 (methyl and primary alkyldiazonium salts) substitution and elimination reactions. They have been used as substrates in physical organic chemistry studies, but their uncontrolled reactivity generally renders them synthetically unimportant. (As an exception, a methyldiazonium carboxylate ion pair is believed to be a fleeting intermediate in the methylation of carboxylic acids by diazomethane). On the other hand, aryldiazonium salts are more stable (though still dangerously explosive under certain conditions) and are highly versatile reagents for chemical synthesis and important intermediates in the organic synthesis of azo dyes.\n[6301567#0] Alkalide - An alkalide is a chemical compound in which alkali metal atoms are anions (negative ions) with a charge or oxidation state of –1. Until the first discovery of alkalides in the 1970s, alkali metals were only known to appear in salts only as cations (positive ions) with a charge or oxidation state of +1. These types of compounds are of theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionization potentials. Alkalide compounds are chemically related to the electrides, salts in which trapped electrons are effectively the anions.\n[666#4] Alkali metal - Sodium compounds have been known since ancient times; salt (sodium chloride) has been an important commodity in human activities, as testified by the English word \"salary\", referring to \"salarium\", money paid to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include either alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What is shell shock?\n\nContexts: [1019091#2] Combat stress reaction - In World War I, shell shock was considered a psychiatric illness resulting from injury to the nerves during combat. The horrors of trench warfare meant that about 10% of the fighting soldiers were killed (compared to 4.5% during World War II) and the total proportion of troops who became casualties (killed or wounded) was 56%. Whether a shell-shock sufferer was considered \"wounded\" or \"sick\" depended on the circumstances. When faced with the phenomenon of a minority of soldiers mentally breaking down, there was an expectation that the root of this problem lay in character of the individual soldier, not because of what they experienced on the front lines during the war. These sorts of attitudes helped fuel the main argument that was accepted after the war and going forward that there was a social root to shell shock that consisted of soldiers finding the only way allowed by the military to show weakness and get out of the front, claiming that their mental anguish constituted a legitimate medical diagnosis as a disease. The large proportion of World War I veterans in the European population meant that the symptoms were common to the culture.\n[36013687#14] Elmer Ernest Southard - During the World War I era, Southard conducted early studies of shell shock. He believed that shell shock resulted from the mind's inability to align the sensory experiences of war with other life events. Southard said that this process, which could also have physical causes, resulted in disorientation and transformed the events of war into a mental condition. In \"Shell Shock and Other Neuropsychiatric Problems\", he called the term \"shell shock\" advantageous because it \"compared with the more acutely terrible and life-in-the-balance thing we know as traumatic or surgical shock.\" The condition initially captured public interest, at least in part because it was thought to result from a traumatic force to the head. When shell shock became known as not resulting from physical injuries, patients were stigmatized and arguments over its cause interfered with effective treatment.\n[22290028#6] Shell shock - At the same time an alternative view developed describing shell shock as an emotional, rather than a physical, injury. Evidence for this point of view was provided by the fact that an increasing proportion of men suffering shell shock symptoms had not been exposed to artillery fire. Since the symptoms appeared in men who had no proximity to an exploding shell, the physical explanation was clearly unsatisfactory.\n[42464743#0] Shell Shock (film) - Shell Shock, also known as 82nd Marines Attack, is a 1964 film B-movie directed and co-written by John Hayes and produced by and starring Beach Dickerson. The film takes place in Italy during World War II, and tells the story of a sergeant with his group of soldiers.\n[358103#2] Michelle Shocked - In 1984, Johnston adopted the stage name \"Michelle Shocked,\" a play on the expression \"shell shocked,\" she said in a 1992 interview with \"Green Left Weekly\": \"The term 'Miss shell shocked' is a direct reference to the thousand-yard stare, which was a term that they first used to describe the victims of shell-shock in World War I. These people from outward appearances had survived the war quite well when in fact inside their minds were blown. I first used that name in 1984 at the Democratic Convention in San Francisco where I was arrested for protesting and demonstrating against corporations who contribute money to both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party campaigns.\"\n[22290028#1] Shell shock - During the War, the concept of shell shock was ill-defined. Cases of \"shell shock\" could be interpreted as either a physical or psychological injury, or simply as a lack of moral fibre. The term \"shell shock\" is still used by the Veterans Administration to describe certain parts of PTSD, but mostly it has entered into popular imagination and memory, and it is often identified as the signature injury of the War.\n[19466336#92] British Army during World War I - At the time Posttraumatic stress disorder (known as \"shell shock\" because it was initially wrongly thought to be caused by concussion damage to the membranes of the brain) was beginning to be recognised and was - in principle - admissible in defence; it was classified as a war injury, although there were concerns that soldiers accused of offences tried falsely to claim shell shock as a defence. One historian writes that \"in no case was a soldier whom the medical staff certified as suffering from shell shock actually executed\", that \"there appear to have been very few cases where men who alleged shell shock, but whose claim was denied, were actually executed\", and that the suggestions of modern campaigners that most of the executed men suffered from shell shock are \"palpably untrue\". However, another historian has pointed out that there was a great deal of chance in whether a soldier's claim of shell-shock would be taken seriously, and gives examples of soldiers being given cursory medical examinations or none; specific references to shell-shock are uncommon, and records usually refer to dizziness, \"queer turns\", bad nerves etc. Such trauma was still poorly understood at that time.\n[22290028#4] Shell shock - The term \"shell shock\" came into use to reflect an assumed link between the symptoms and the effects of explosions from artillery shells. The term was first published in 1915 in an article in \"The Lancet\" by Charles Myers. Some 60–80% of shell shock cases displayed acute neurasthenia, while 10% displayed what would now be termed symptoms of conversion disorder, including mutism and fugue.\n[15767764#49] Post-traumatic amnesia - Although there was a general lack of knowledge about its mechanisms, a review of patients seen during WWI combat reveals the symptoms of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) in many soldiers. The term shell shock was used to refer to the acute psychological state that accompanied exposure to exploding shells, and more generally, exposure to combat conditions. There are a number of documented cases of shell shock victims. These soldiers commonly displayed dizziness, varying degrees of consciousness, a loss of non-traumatic personal information, and a lack of normal self-awareness lasting anywhere from hours to days. Many of the symptoms of shell shock are highly similar to those of PTA. The following excerpt from a case report illustrates the loss of personal information observed in one patient:\nResearchers found that physicians had documented reports of combatants where \"[b]oth central and peripheral details of the traumatic experience were lost.\" Patients displayed gaps in memory recollection for the period following the trauma, sometimes up to the time of hospitalization, which could be weeks later.\n[22290028#18] Shell shock - Some men suffering from shell shock were put on trial, and even executed, for military crimes including desertion and cowardice. While it was recognised that the stresses of war could cause men to break down, a lasting episode was likely to be seen as symptomatic of an underlying lack of character. For instance, in his testimony to the post-war Royal Commission examining shell shock, Lord Gort said that shell shock was a weakness and was not found in \"good\" units. The continued pressure to avoid medical recognition of shell shock meant that it was not, in itself, considered an admissible defence.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Where does methane come from naturally?\n\nContexts: [19480112#1] Arctic methane emissions - The Arctic region is one of the many natural sources of the greenhouse gas methane. Global warming accelerates its release, due to both release of methane from existing stores, and from methanogenesis in rotting biomass. Large quantities of methane are stored in the Arctic in natural gas deposits, permafrost, and as undersea clathrates. Permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming. Other sources of methane include submarine taliks, river transport, ice complex retreat, submarine permafrost and decaying gas hydrate deposits.\n[54137#19] Methane clathrate - Economic deposits of hydrate are termed Natural Gas Hydrate (NGH) and are unique in that they store 164 m of methane, 0.8 m water in 1 m hydrate. Most NGH is found beneath the seafloor (95%) where it exists in thermodynamic equilibrium. The sedimentary methane hydrate reservoir probably contains 2–10 times the currently known reserves of conventional natural gas, . This represents a potentially important future source of hydrocarbon fuel. However, in the majority of sites deposits are thought to be too dispersed for economic extraction. Other problems facing commercial exploitation are detection of viable reserves and development of the technology for extracting methane gas from the hydrate deposits.\n[5676885#33] Biofuel in the United States - Many cellulosic biomass materials produce methane naturally. Methane is the main component of natural gas. Naturally occurring methane is often considered a source of pollution from landfills, dairy farms, and human waste sources. The EPA routinely issues rules to reduce the emission of methane from landfills and other sources.\n[1646739#10] Playa Vista, Los Angeles - According to officials at the L.A. Department of Building and Safety, \"Methane is an old story in Los Angeles and the standards the city requires at Playa Vista are the strictest in the country. Hence, Playa residents we spoke to cited areas where the gas has not been mitigated - such as Venice, Santa Monica, and nearly all of the Westside - as more dangerous.\" Many also argue that \"much of the methane is natural - not the kind that comes from the gas company.\"\n[1816518#5] Methanol economy - Today most methanol is produced from methane through syngas. Trinidad and Tobago is currently the world's largest methanol exporter, with exports mainly to the United States. The natural gas that serves as feedstock for the production of methanol comes from the same sources as other uses. Unconventional gas resources such as coalbed methane, tight sand gas and eventually the very large methane hydrate resources present under the continental shelves of the seas and Siberian and Canadian tundra could also be used to provide the necessary gas.\n[18582230#38] Methane - Methane was discovered and isolated by Alessandro Volta between 1776 and 1778 when studying marsh gas from Lake Maggiore. It is the major component of natural gas, about 87% by volume. The major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as natural gas fields, with coal seam gas extraction becoming a major source (see Coal bed methane extraction, a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit, while enhanced coal bed methane recovery is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams). It is associated with other hydrocarbon fuels, and sometimes accompanied by helium and nitrogen. Methane is produced at shallow levels (low pressure) by anaerobic decay of organic matter and reworked methane from deep under the Earth's surface. In general, the sediments that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain oil.\n[67458#3] Coalbed methane extraction - Tens of thousands of methane wells have been drilled, and extensive support facilities such as roads, pipelines, and compressors have been installed for CBM extraction in the Powder River Basin of northeast Wyoming and southeast Montana and now in India at West Bengal- Ranigunj, Panagarh etc. Seven percent of the natural gas (methane) currently produced in the United States comes from CBM extraction. Methane from coalbed reservoirs can be recovered economically, but disposal of water is an environmental concern.\n[50525886#136] Hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry - Methane is a major component of natural gas. Geosphere methane is intriguing for the large input of microbial methanogenesis. This process exhibits a strong isotope effect, resulting in greater D-depletion in methane relative to other hydrocarbons. δD ranges from -275‰ to -100‰ in thermogenic methane, and from -400‰ to -150‰ in microbial methane. Also, methane formed by marine methanogens is generally enriched in D relative to methane from freshwater methanogens. δD of methane has been plotted together with other geochemical tools(like δC, gas wetness) to categorize and identify natural gas. A δD-δC diagram (sometimes referred to as CD diagram, Whiticar diagram, or Schoell diagram ) is widely used to place methane in one of the three distinct groups: thermogenic methane that is higher in both δC and δD; marine microbial methane that is more depleted in C and freshwater microbial methane that is more depleted in D. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis produces less D-depleted methane relative to acetoclastic methanogenesis. The location where the organism lives and substrate concentration also affect isotopic composition: rumen methanogenesis, which occurs in a more closed system and with higher partial pressures of hydrogen, exhibits a greater fractionation (-300 to -400‰) than wetland methanogenesis (-250 to -170‰).\nRecent advances in analytical chemistry have enabled high-precision measurements of multiply substituted isotopologues (or 'clumped isotopologues') like CHD. This emerge as a novel tool for studying methane formation. This proxy is based on the abundance of clumped isotopologues of methane, which should be enriched compared to the stochastic distribution at thermodynamic equilibrium because the reduced zero-point energy for heavy-heavy isotope bonding is more than twice the reduced zero-point energy of heavy-light isotope bonding. The extent of enrichment decreases with increasing temperature, as higher entropy tends to randomize isotope distribution. Stolper et al. established this temperature calibration using laboratory equilibrated methane and field methane from known formation temperature, and applied this to several gas reservoirs to study natural gas formation and mixing. Wang et al. also reported strong non-equilibrium isotope effect in methane clumped isotopes from lab-cultured methanogens and field samples. These methane samples have relatively low abundance of clumped isotopologues, sometimes even lower than the stochastic distribution. This indicates that there are irreversible steps in enzymatic reactions during methanogenesis that fractionation against clumped isotopologues to create the depleted signal. Isotope clumping in methane has proven a robust proxy, and scientists are now moving towards higher-order alkane molecules like ethane for further work.\n[35494376#34] Environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing - A study by Cabot Oil and Gas examined the Duke study using a larger sample size, found that methane concentrations were related to topography, with the highest readings found in low-lying areas, rather than related to distance from gas production areas. Using a more precise isotopic analysis, they showed that the methane found in the water wells came from both the formations where hydraulic fracturing occurred, and from the shallower formations. The Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission investigates complaints from water well owners, and has found some wells to contain biogenic methane unrelated to oil and gas wells, but others that have thermogenic methane due to oil and gas wells with leaking well casing. A review published in February 2012 found no direct evidence that hydraulic fracturing actual injection phase resulted in contamination of ground water, and suggests that reported problems occur due to leaks in its fluid or waste storage apparatus; the review says that methane in water wells in some areas probably comes from natural resources.\n[23092516#80] Atmospheric methane - Another source of methane emissions has been identified in Russia. Near Yamburg and Urengoy exist gas fields with a methane concentration of 97 percent. The gas obtained from these fields is taken and exported to Western and Central Europe through an extensive pipeline system known as the Trans-Siberian natural gas pipeline system. In accordance with the IPCC and other natural gas emissions control groups, measurements had to be taken throughout the pipeline to measure methane emissions from technological discharges and leaks at the pipeline fittings and vents. Although the majority of the natural gas leaks were carbon dioxide, a significant amount of methane was also being consistently released from the pipeline as a result of leaks and breakdowns. In 2001, natural gas emissions from the pipeline and natural gas transportation system accounted for 1 percent of the natural gas produced. Fortunately, between 2001 and 2005, this number reduced to 0.7 percent, and even the 2001 value is still significantly less than that of 1996.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: How many terms can a United States president have?\n\nContexts: [3434750#90] United States - The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one-third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories do not have senators. The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia. The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.\n[24113#43] President of the United States - Since the amendment's adoption, five presidents have served two full terms: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Both Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush sought a second term, but were defeated. Richard Nixon was elected to a second term, but resigned before completing it. Lyndon B. Johnson, having held the presidency for one full term in addition to only 14 months of John F. Kennedy's unexpired term, was eligible for a second full term in 1968, but withdrew from Democratic Primary. Additionally, Gerald Ford, who served out the last two years and five months of Nixon's second term, sought a full term, but was defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election.\n[10826158#7] Term of office - In the United States, the president of the United States is elected indirectly through the United States Electoral College to a four-year term, with a term limit of two terms (totaling eight years) or a maximum of ten years if the president acted as president for two years or less in a term where another was elected as president, imposed by the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1951.\n[3556902#15] United States presidential inauguration - Since 1789 there have been 58 inaugural ceremonies to mark the commencement of a new four-year term of a president of the United States, and an additional nine marking the start of a partial presidential term following the intra-term death or resignation of an incumbent president. With the 2017 inauguration of Donald Trump, the oath has been taken 75 different times by 44 people. This numerical discrepancy results chiefly from two factors: a president must take the oath at the beginning of each term of office, and, because the day of inauguration has sometimes fallen on a Sunday, five presidents have taken the oath privately before the public inaugural ceremonies. In addition, three have repeated the oath as a precaution against potential later constitutional challenges.\n[5046614#2] President of Montenegro - Each president has a term of 5 years in office. Each president can have two terms in office. The President is elected through direct and secret ballots. In the event of a state of war during term of office of the President of Montenegro shall be extended for as long as the state of war exists.\n[2015257#19] Powers of the President of the United States - As head of the executive branch, the president appoints the top officials for all federal agencies. These positions are listed in the Plum Book which outlines more than seven thousand appointive positions in the government. Many of these appointments are made by the president. In the case of ten agencies, the president is free to appoint a new agency head. For example, it is not unusual for the CIA's Director or NASA's Administrator to be changed by the president. Other agencies that deal with federal regulation such as the Federal Reserve Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission have set terms that will often outlast presidential terms. For example, governors of the Federal Reserve serve for fourteen years to ensure agency independence. The president also appoints members to the boards of directors for government-owned corporations such as Amtrak. The president can also make a recess appointment if a position needs to be filled while Congress is not in session.\n[26107554#1] List of Chairs of the National Labor Relations Board - The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has five Members, each of whom serves for a five-year term. Terms are staggered so that one Member's term expires each year (although delays in nominations and confirmation, as well as the use of recess appointments, can upset this schedule). Members are nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. Traditionally, a majority of the board belongs to the President's political party. The President designates the Chair from one of the existing Members. The Chair serves at the pleasure of the President, and may be demoted without cause or warning at any time.\n[8882101#1] Midterm election - In the United States, the president and vice president are elected every four years in indirect (electoral college) presidential elections. The legislative bodies of the United States are the Senate (who serve six year terms) and House of Representatives (2 year terms). The Senate has one-third of its members up for election every two years while the House has all its membership up for election every two years. Regarding elections to the United States Congress, the point of reference is the president's term. There are three classes of United States Senators; each election replaces one class, hence a \"midterm election\" appears as one-third through the term of one class and two-thirds through the other, while still midway the term of a president. In addition to federal legislative bodies, governors of 36 states and three territories are also up for election during a midterm election.\n[505825#4] Term limit - Many modern presidential republics employ term limits for their highest offices. The United States placed a limit of two terms on its presidency by means of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution in 1951. There are no term limits for Vice Presidency, Representatives and Senators, although there have been calls for term limits for those offices. Under various state laws, some state governors and state legislators have term limits. Formal limits in America date back to the 1682 Pennsylvania Charter of Liberties, and the colonial frame of government of the same year, authored by William Penn and providing for triennial rotation of the provincial council, the upper house of the colonial legislature. (See also term limits in the United States).\n[31644#86] United States Constitution - The Twenty-second Amendment (1951) limits an elected president to two terms in office, a total of eight years. However, under some circumstances it is possible for an individual to serve more than eight years. Although nothing in the original frame of government limited how many presidential terms one could serve, the nation's first president, George Washington, declined to run for a third term, suggesting that two terms of four years were enough for any president. This precedent remained an unwritten rule of the presidency until broken by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected to a third term as president 1940 and in 1944 to a fourth.\n[1038417#2] List of Presidents of the United States by time in office - William Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office, and Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest. Roosevelt is the only president to have served more than two terms. Following ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment in 1951, presidents—beginning with Dwight D. Eisenhower—have been ineligible for election to a third term or for election to a second full term after serving more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president. The amendment contained a grandfather clause that explicitly exempted the incumbent president, then Harry S. Truman, from the new term limitations, which first applied to Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What happens when the president and VP of the USA die?\n\nContexts: [13434603#2] List of Presidents of the United States who died in office - On March 26, 1841, William Henry Harrison became ill with a cold. According to the prevailing medical misconception of that time, it was believed that his illness was directly caused by the bad weather at his inauguration; however, Harrison's illness did not arise until more than three weeks after the event. The cold worsened, rapidly turning to pneumonia and pleurisy. He sought to rest in the White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers. His extremely busy social schedule made any rest time scarce.\n[30370167#11] Abdelghani Bousta - From May 1973 to September 1974, Abdelghani Bousta lived in hiding. During this time, he realised the mistakes made when the March 1973 events were organised. In 1975, he wrote a critical analysis of UNFP on behalf of the Option Révolutionnaire (Revolutionary option) movement, harshly criticising the events and the leaders: “[…] the March 1973 events helped shed light on the internal contradictions of the Party and show the true nature of its leaders: putschist and adventurous leaders who did not see any problem in sacrificing dozens of activists in a hazardous battle.”\n[20107159#26] President-elect of the United States - If the Vice President-elect dies or resigns \"before\" the meeting of the Electoral College in December, the National Committee of the winning party would, in consultation with the president-elect, choose a replacement to receive the electoral votes of the Vice Presidential nominee in the same manner as would happen if the former Vice Presidential nominee had become President-elect due to the death of the apparent winner. Assuming the requisite number the electors agreed to vote for the replacement candidate, that person would then become the Vice President-elect. If such a vacancy were to occur \"after\" the electoral votes had been cast in the states, most authorities maintain that no replacement would be chosen and the new President (after taking office) would nominate a Vice President, per the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\n[3121816#5] Traditions of the United States Senate - If a Senator dies in office, it is traditional for the Senate to adjourn for a day and for U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff. A black cloth and a vase filled with white roses are placed over the deceased Senator's desk, and a large contingent of Senators often travel to the home state of the departed senator to pay their respects.\n[20107159#14] President-elect of the United States - If the apparent winner dies between the College's December vote and its counting in Congress in January, the Twelfth Amendment stipulates that all electoral ballots cast shall be counted, presumably even those for a dead candidate. The U.S. House committee reporting on the proposed Twentieth Amendment said the \"Congress would have 'no discretion' [and] 'would declare that the deceased candidate had received a majority of the votes.'\"\n[41959688#0] Winfield Toll Bridge - Winfield Toll Bridge, also known as the Ross Booth Memorial Bridge, is a historic three-span cantilever Warren Truss bridge located at Winfield and Red House, Putnam County, West Virginia. It was built in 1955, and spans the Kanawha River, carrying West Virginia Route 34. The cantilever through-truss consists of two anchor spans each 245 feet in length and the main span 462 feet in length between pier center lines. The main span consists of two 128 feet, 4 inch, cantilever arms and a 205 feet, 4 inch, suspended span.\n[1815992#9] Hull University Union - Because of the nature of the cross campus elections for the Executive posts, it is in theory possible for any member of the Union to stand for any post, and thus in the past this was capable of creating the anomaly that the VP-S&L (Cross Campus election) could have been held by a separate person from the post of President of the Athletic Union (Internal AU election) and the VP-SCA could have been separate from Chair HUSSO. While changes to the constitution/standing orders have removed the possibility of this happening for Chair-HUSSO, it is still theoretically possible to have the posts of Vice President Scarborough held by a student who is neither a resident of the town, or undertaking a course at the campus. This happened in the elections of 2010 and 2011 when Matthew Jason Brown who graduated from Scarborough two years before, but was undertaking a course on the Hull campus was elected to the post and then reelected the subsequent year.\n[3088980#1] The Man (Wallace novel) - \"The Man\" was written before the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It depicts a political situation in which the office of Vice Presidency is vacant due to the incumbent's death. While overseas in Germany, the President and the Speaker of the House are in a freak accident; the President is killed, the Speaker of the House later dies in surgery. The Presidency then devolves onto Douglass Dilman, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, a black man earlier elected to that office in deference to his race. Dilman's presidency is challenged by white racists, black political activists, and an attempted assassination. Later, he is impeached on false charges for firing the United States Secretary of State. One of his children, who is \"passing\" for white, is targeted and harassed. At the end of the book the protagonist - though having credibly dealt with considerable problems during his Presidency and gained some popularity - does not consider running for re-election.\n[24147412#22] State funerals in the United States - Sitting presidents who die while in office may lie in repose in the East Room of the White House. Former presidents may lie in repose in their home or adopted state, usually at their presidential library, before traveling to Washington, D.C. when thereafter, lying in state in the United States Capitol Rotunda will occur. Dwight D. Eisenhower was an exception to this general rule. Following his death at Walter Reed Army Hospital in 1969, Eisenhower lay in repose in the Bethlehem Chapel at Washington National Cathedral for 28 hours, rather than at his presidential library in Abilene, Kansas.\n[31644#87] United States Constitution - The Twenty-fifth Amendment (1967) clarifies what happens upon the death, removal, or resignation of the President or Vice President and how the Presidency is temporarily filled if the President becomes disabled and cannot fulfill the responsibilities of the office. It supersedes the ambiguous succession rule established in . A concrete plan of succession has been needed on multiple occasions since 1789. However, for nearly 20% of U.S. history, there has been no vice president in office who can assume the presidency.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When did Iain Norman Macleod die?\n\nContexts: [242789#0] Iain Macleod - Iain Norman Macleod (11 November 1913 – 20 July 1970) was a British Conservative Party politician and government minister.\n[28474862#1] Norman MacLeod (The Wicked Man) - Norman MacLeod was the younger son of Norman MacLeod, chief of Clan MacLeod. The elder Norman MacLeod died in 1706, leaving two young sons. The elder son, John, died in infancy in 1707. MacLeod was the Member of Parliament for Inverness-shire during the years 1741-1754. He matriculated arms, and supporters, at Lyon Office, on 12 January 1753. He supported the Government cause in the Jacobite Rising, and was an absentee chief as he seldom lived at his ancestors' traditional seat of Dunvegan Castle.\n[242789#39] Iain Macleod - Suez alienated academics, journalists and other opinion-formers from the Conservative Party. William Rees-Mogg, then a Conservative candidate in the North-East, made a speech urging that Macleod be party leader. David Astor of \"The Observer\", who on 4 November had attacked Eden for \"crookedness\" in an editorial, wrote to Macleod on 14 November, urging him as a younger minister to seize the party leadership so that collusion could be pinned on Eden and Lloyd, after Edward Boyle had told him that he was not interested and that Monckton was not up to it. Macleod did not reply but showed the letter to Freddie Bishop, head of the Prime Minister's Private Office, and Cabinet Secretary Norman Brook for their comments; Eden, who was on the verge of a breakdown, did not regard the matter as important. On 20 November 1956 the question of collusion was raised in Cabinet, with Eden and Lloyd (who was in New York at a United Nations meeting) both absent; Shepherd believes that it was probably Macleod who raised it. The Cabinet agreed to stick to Lloyd's formula that Britain had not \"incited\" the Israeli attack on Egypt.\n[25801683#0] Iain Ciar MacLeod - Iain Ciar MacLeod (Scottish Gaelic: Iain Ciar MacLeòid) (1330 – \"c.\"1392) is considered to be fourth chief of Clan MacLeod. He was the eldest son of, and is thought to have succeeded his father, Malcolm, in the years spanning 1360–1370. Clan tradition states that he was the most tyrannical of all MacLeod chiefs. His wife supposedly was as cruel as he was; she is said to have had two of her daughters buried alive in the dungeon of Dunvegan Castle when they attempted to leave the clan. Iain Ciar was killed in an ambush in about 1392. He was succeeded by his second and only surviving son, William Cleireach.\n[242789#3] Iain Macleod - Macleod did not contest the first ever Conservative Party leadership election in 1965, but endorsed the eventual winner Edward Heath. When the Conservatives returned to power in June 1970, he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in Heath's government, but died suddenly only a month later.\n[13865893#2] Evelyn Macleod, Baroness Macleod of Borve - On 3 July 1937, she married Mervyn Charles Mason (1907–1940), second son of Alwyne Mason of Foxley Manor, near Malmesbury, Wiltshire. During World War II, she worked for the London ambulance service and her husband was a Lieutenant in the Pioneer Corps. In 1940, he was killed after his ship was torpedoed off the coast of Ireland and she later married the future politician, Iain Norman Macleod, a member of the branch of the Macleods of Pabbay and Uig.\n[242789#54] Iain Macleod - Macleod used government papers in breach of the \"Fifty-year rule\" then in operation. Cabinet Secretary Sir Norman Brook persuaded the Prime Minister to demand amendments to conceal the degree of Cabinet involvement in the abdication of King Edward VIII (who was still alive in 1961) and the degree to which the civil servants Horace Wilson and Warren Fisher had demanded that the former King \"reorder his private life\" afterwards. Former Prime Minister Lord Avon, who cherished his (somewhat exaggerated) reputation as an opponent of \"appeasement\", complained that such a book by a serving Cabinet Minister might be thought to express official sympathy for Chamberlain's policies. Downing Street had to brief the press that Macleod had written purely in a personal capacity; Shepherd suggests that Macleod's loss of favour with Macmillan, who had also been an opponent of appeasement, was accelerated by this episode. Robert Blake wrote in his review in \"The Times\" (26 November 1961) that \"when national security is at stake one does not judge a statesman by his successes at slum clearance\". Macleod later told Alan Watkins (in \"\"Brief Lives\"\" 1982) \"It was a bad book. I made a great mistake in writing it. It made me no money, and it has done me a lot of harm\". Watkins conceded that the book \"had been grudgingly and meanly reviewed\". The book \"sold poorly and was soon forgotten\".\n[242789#32] Iain Macleod - On 25 August, the day after Monckton's \"outburst\" expressing doubts at the Egypt Committee, Cabinet Secretary Norman Brook sent a note to Eden listing Macleod as among those Cabinet members (the others being Butler, Monckton, Heathcoat Amory, the Earl of Selkirk, Kilmuir and Heath who, as Chief Whip, attended Cabinet but was not technically a full member) who would want to postpone military action until all other options had been exhausted or until Nasser provided them with a better pretext, whichever came first. There were three unknowns and ten hawks—a narrow Cabinet majority in favour of military action.\n[242789#4] Iain Macleod - Iain Macleod was born at Clifford House, Skipton, Yorkshire, on 11 November 1913. His father, Dr. Norman Alexander Macleod, was a well-respected general practitioner in Skipton, with a substantial poor-law practice (providing medical services for those who could not afford to pay); the young Macleod would often accompany his father on his rounds. His parents were from the Isle of Lewis in the Western Isles of Scotland, belonging to the branch of the Macleods of Pabbay and Uig. They moved to Skipton in 1907. Macleod grew up with strong personal and cultural ties to Scotland, as his parents bought in 1917 part of the Leverhulme estate on the Isle of Lewis, where they often used to stay for family holidays.\n[25777652#0] Iain Borb MacLeod - Iain Borb MacLeod (Scottish Gaelic: Iain Borb MacLeòid; Anglicised as: John \"the Turbulent\" MacLeod) (1392–1442) is considered to be the sixth chief of Clan MacLeod. He is the first MacLeod chief to which heraldry can be assigned. Clan tradition states that he was a minor at the time of his father's death and for six years an incompetent guardian led the clan to its lowest point in clan history. After reaching the age of maturity, Iain Borb managed to acquire some of the clan's lost lands and led his clan and his kinsmen (the MacLeods of Lewis) in the Battle of Harlaw, in 1411. Iain Borb was wounded in the head during the conflict; the wound never completely healed and confined him to his home on Pabbay for much of his life. Tradition states that he died when this wound re-opened during a fencing/wrestling match. There is some disagreement as to which of his son's were the eldest; however, his son William Dubh was the one who finally succeeded to the chiefship, following his death in 1442.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When did the Isle of Man Railway start running?\n\nContexts: [924482#6] Isle of Man Railway - Formed in 1870 with the first line following three years later, the Isle of Man Railway Company operated services until 1977 (see below) merging with the Manx Northern Railway and Foxdale Railway in 1905. The railway is now marketed as the \"Steam Railway\" to differentiate it from the Manx Electric Railway, operated by the same department. It was marketed as \"Isle of Man Railway\" until closure in 1965. From 1969 to 1972, it operated as the \"Isle of Mann Victorian Steam Railway Company Limited\", reverting to Isle of Man Railway. When nationalised in 1978 it fell under the banner of \"Isle of Man Railways\", along with the Manx Electric Railway. Re-branding to \"Isle of Man Passenger Transport\" took place from 1984 but the steam line was not affected, and this reverted to \"Isle of Man Railways\" from 1990, when a re-branding exercise took place with the emphasis on the Victorian origins of the railway. A change in management style occurred in 1999, and trains, trams and buses were presented as \"Isle of Man Transport\". The electric railway was affected more by this change, with a series of non-historical and modern liveries, but in 2007 this was changed and the railway is marketed once more as the \"Isle of Man Railway\". In keeping with the historical aspect, coaches and locomotives carry original names and transfers. The banner heading of all the railways was again changed in 2009 and became collectively known as \"Isle of Man Heritage Railways\", although the \"heritage\" tag has been dropped latterly. Joint timetabling with the Manx Electric Railway sees the line titled as the \"Steam Railway\" in marketing material.\n[924482#35] Isle of Man Railway - The earliest use of the railway as a backdrop for filming purposes appears to have been in 1946 when \"I See A Dark Stranger\" used Union Mills station in the opening scenes, doubling as a station in Ireland. The Isle of Man was one of the locations for the movie \"Thomas and the Magic Railroad\" when Castletown station became \"Shining Time station\" while the goods shed at Port Erin became Burnett Stone's workshop, containing a replica of \"Lady\", although the trains themselves were not used during production. Other locations were used to represent the entrance to Burnett's workshop (an old lead mine) and the entry to the Magic Railroad (near the old lead mine), and a workshop in Port Erin was used to store properties, presumably including the Lady replica. The railway has also been used during the filming of \"The Brylcreem Boys\" using on-board views and Douglas station, \"Five Children & It\" for which Castletown station was fitted with a temporary canopy and given period set dressing, Channel 4's production of \"Cinderella\" that saw Santon station used heavily, the BBC adaptation of \"The Ginger Tree\" in which it doubled for communist Russia using the carriage shed at Douglas, lineside scenes and Castletown station (№ 11 \"Maitland\" was painted matte black for this production and remained in this guide for the remainder of the 1989 season) as well as being the subject of a 1988 BBC documentary as part of the \"Train Now Departing...\" series in an episode called \"Steam in the Isle Of Man\". Other television credits include an adaptation of \"The Legend Of The Tamworth Two\", the television movie \"Stiff Upper Lips\" and the long-running travelog show \"Wish You Were Here...?\" which featured Sir Norman Wisdom.\n[13213443#1] Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association - The group was originally one of two (the other being the short-lived Mannin Railway Group which was merged to form the one association within the first few months) formed in 1966 when the future of the Isle of Man Railway hung in the balance, this group provided a watchdog role over the railway until it was eventually nationalised in 1978 when the future of the remaining section from Douglas to Port Erin was assured. In 1966 however, the railway did not operate any services for the first time in its history which dates back to 1873 when the line to Peel was opened.\n[13248302#9] Isle of Man Railway rolling stock - A further development of this policy occurred between 1909 and 1926 when the bodies of the four wheel coaches were removed from their original chassis and mounted in pairs on to bogie underframes supplied by Metropolitan. By the late 1950s, relatively few were used in regular service, but two sets were reserved for schools traffic. These were used in regular service on exceptionally busy days, such as Tynwald Day, but otherwise were confined to the school runs. By this time they were painted in a utilitarian all-over brown colour scheme. Oddly, several of the pairs were rehabilitated in the early 1970s, as their steel frames were of relatively recent date. Surviving pairs carriages are mostly in poor condition, as their bodies date from 1873–75, and have been surrounded by a certain amount of controversy in recent years, having been removed from the railway for storage. The Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association have campaigned for their retention on the railway. Some are now in the carriage sheds at Douglas and Port Erin, four in open storage at Port St. Mary protected with tarpaulins.\n[6181707#2] Manx Northern Railway - Built to a common Manx gauge, a narrow gauge, construction began in 1878 and the railway opened for business without formality on 23 September 1879. It was operated by the Isle of Man Railway until 6 November 1880 when the MNR took over the responsibility. In 1881, passenger services started operating through to Douglas using running rights over the tracks of the Isle of Man Railway.\nSome significant engineering works were required on the west coast section of the line, including the bridging of Glen Wyllin (at Kirk Michael) and the nearby Glen Mooar. An embankment high on the cliffs south of Glen Mooar, the \"Donkey Bank\", was an unending maintenance problem and a drain upon the line's profitability. To try to stabilise the track, this section was the only part of the Manx railways to have its rails mounted in chairs. The rest of the system had the rails directly spiked to the sleepers.\n[13213443#9] Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association - Since the nationalisation of the railway secured its future the main thrust of the group has been the restoration of the Groudle Glen Railway commencing in 1982 and the line continues today. Since starting the project, at which time the line had been reduced to a footpath, the line has been relaid to its full length for the first time since 1939 which was officially opened in 1992, seen the return of the original steam locomotive Sea Lion to service in 1987, the erection of various replica station buildings starting with the station canopy in 1993, and the continuing improvement of the line as one of the island's tourist attractions; this has included the added attraction of visiting steam locomotives, gala days in conjunction with Isle of Man Heritage Railways and popular off-season events such as \"Santa Trains\" and \"Bunny Trains\" each Easter weekend. In more recent times there have also been \"Jester Express\" days, promotions in connection with Father's Day and operations on New Year's Day were introduced in 2011. Additionally, \"Driver Experience Days\" are also offered where, for a fee, members of the public may spend the day on the footplate of a steam locomotive and drive trains. The railway is now a stand-alone charity and operates seasonally, whilst the volunteers of the Supporters' Association continue to maintain strong ties with the Isle of Man Railway albeit in a watchdog role, and provision of project items. The group maintains a strong working relationship with the management and attends regular meetings to ensure the development.\n[13353944#6] Ramsey railway station (Isle of Man Railway) - Under the original Manx Northern Railway operations, trains ran to St. John's, where there was a junction with the Isle of Man Railway's Peel to Douglas line. Some trains continued on to Douglas by agreement with the other company, and by 1888 when the northern company was struggling financially, the larger company took responsibility for all operational activities, ultimately taking over the whole line in 1905. Owing to the close proximity of the railway-owned Glen Wyllin Pleasure Grounds some services terminated at Kirk Michael from here. After the merger, through services to Douglas and stations on the south line were offered. During the wars the north line was busy with troop carrying trains which started from here.\n[6461508#1] Isle of Man Railway Museum - The museum was first opened in 1975 when the Isle of Man Road Services (a subsidiary of the railway company) relocated to their new garage which is still extant today at the foot of the main platform. At this time the railway only operated between Port Erin and Castletown in an experimental season attempting to reduce running costs; the following year services were extended to Ballasalla before finally returning to Douglas in 1977 since when the full line has operated. The building, consisted of metal frame and asbestos cladding and for this reason was extensively rebuilt in 1999, since which time it has included a souvenir shop which is housed in the former goods shed; prior to this, the locomotives were kept overnight in this goods shed, the original locomotive shed being used only to store unservicable locomotives; when the museum was modified the locomotive shed returned to its original use and the goods shed converted into a shop area with new porch added.\n[13260176#21] Isle of Man Railway locomotives - When the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee was selling surplus assets in the early 1960s, the Isle of Man Railway were looking for a cheap alternative to their ageing steam locomotive fleet and purchased these two railcars. They had already been allocated fleet numbers which were retained by the new owners but it was only when the ex-contractors' engine No. 18 \"Ailsa\" was officially numbered in 2005 that the fleet had ever been in correct sequence. These railcars have been the subject of much controversy in the late 1990s when their over-budget rebuild was brought to a halt by incoming management and since this time no work has been done on them. The preservationist group Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association have campaigned for their completion, especially in conjunction with a potential commuter train services between Port Erin, Castletown and Douglas, which would extend the service that is laid on annually by the railway in connection with the T.T.. The TT Commuter service is currently run using a steam locomotive and hauled stock, which leads to high operating costs. A shift in management attitude could see their return to service in the future, but for the time being, they remain in store at Douglas station awaiting completion and return to service.\n[13213443#0] Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association - The Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association Ltd (IoMSRSA) is a railway preservationist group dedicated to ensuring the continued operation of the Isle of Man Railway on the Isle of Man. Since its inception in 1966 the group has provided volunteer workers, acted in a watchdog role and undertaken the restoration of the Groudle Glen Railway on the island, as well as supporting projects on the railway and producing a journal \"Manx Steam Railway News\" regularly.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Is Gwen Poole part of any teams?\n\nContexts: [4184506#14] Gwen Cooper - In the first series of \"Torchwood\", Gwen functioned as an audience surrogate. Russell T Davies likened her character type to that of 2005–06 \"Doctor Who\" lead female Rose Tyler (Billie Piper): \"She is the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal.\" Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman, who at the same time embodies many aspects of the girl next door archetype. Her distinct role within the team stems from the fact that \"she's there for the people\", who she feels \"instinctive and passionate\" about. Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more \"human empathy\" than the more mercenary members of the team, who are seen to be \"technology-and-alien-obsessed\". In this vein, lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a \"little bit of soul\" back to Jack. Describing the ways in which Gwen's methods differ from the rest of the team, Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job: \"she deals with the families, she deals with profiling, she deals with searching people's backgrounds. It's a new way of working she brings in\". Myles stated that Gwen would have made a \"fantastic policewoman\" prior to joining Torchwood, drawing on the character's ability to get vulnerable characters to \"open up by making them feel comfortable\". Myles perceived Gwen to be \"the heart and emotion of \"Torchwood\"\", and \"Torchwood's social worker\" who can \"run and fight and stand in her own corner and win\". Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity, Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they need her, just as she needs them. Gwen's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one, as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman. Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood, and Myles feels his later appearances \"takes you right back to the beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen\". Myles observed that Gwen's many facets prevent her from getting bored; she feels constantly challenged \"physically\", \"mentally\" and \"morally\" through portraying the character.\n[4184506#13] Gwen Cooper - Lead writer and executive producer Russell T Davies initially had the idea of an unnamed policewoman stumbling across a team of alien investigators in an alley as a premise, before \"Torchwood\" or the 2005 revival of \"Doctor Who\" were commissioned. Having been enamoured by her television performances, most notably in the 2005 episode of \"Doctor Who\" in which she guest-starred, Davies wrote the character of Gwen specifically for Eve Myles. Myles stated that having the part written for her was like her \"own personal Oscar\". Part of the attraction of playing Gwen for Myles was that she had the opportunity to play an action hero with her own accent. Speaking on the casting of Welsh actors on \"Torchwood\", Davies commented that it was deliberately intended, to make the Welsh accent mainstream, \"to make it as acceptable as Scottish or Irish\". In an analysis of Welsh mythology in \"Torchwood\", Lynette Porter observes that Gwen's national consciousness forms part of her characterisation: her knowledge of local myths \"highlights her Welsh heritage and common knowledge from her experience and formal education.\" Discussing the international co-production behind series four, executive producer Julie Gardner commented that Myles' continued involvement helped ensure that the \"flavour of Wales\" remained evident.\n[4184506#4] Gwen Cooper - Gwen is introduced in the first episode of \"Torchwood\", in which she—a Cardiff police officer— witnesses Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) and his team interrogating a dead man in an alley. After investigating the Torchwood team, she locates the Torchwood Institute's Cardiff branch, home to a team of alien hunters. Though Jack wipes her memories, they are later triggered by reports of murders committed with exotic weaponry. Torchwood's own Suzie Costello (Indira Varma) is the serial killer. Gwen is present at Suzie's attempt to kill Jack, and Suzie's ensuing suicide. Jack reveals that he cannot die and offers Gwen a job in Torchwood. Jack and Gwen's relationship takes on a romantic hue, despite her long-standing relationship with boyfriend Rhys (Kai Owen). Gwen falls into a short-lived destructive affair with colleague Owen (Burn Gorman), after a particularly traumatic experience with cannibals, which she cannot share with Rhys. Shortly afterwards, Gwen is targeted and almost killed by a vengeful undead Suzie. In their conversations, Gwen is shocked to realise the extent to which Torchwood neglected Suzie's emotional welfare, and Suzie is resentful towards Gwen, who has replaced her both professionally, and as Owen's lover. Wracked with guilt, Gwen confesses her affair with Owen after it ends in \"Combat\", but she drugs Rhys with an amnesia pill so he will not remember her confession. In the series one finale, her desire to resurrect a murdered Rhys motivates her to mutiny against Jack by opening the rift in time and space which Torchwood monitors. After Jack sacrifices himself to the released supernatural demon, Gwen maintains a vigil, certain that he will resurrect. As she loses hope, giving Jack a parting kiss, he awakens and thanks her. Shortly afterwards, Jack abandons Torchwood to reunite with the mysterious \"Doctor\" from his past.\n[50994304#22] Gwenpool - Gwen goes to visit the Earth-616 version of the Poole family despite MODOK's inability to find any records of Gwen existing before Doctor Strange's intervention, where she is greeted by her brother Teddy, who, for some unknown reason and with no real explanation, drags her back to her world (or a reasonably facsimile) before she can meet the Marvel version of her parents. She's then transported back to her universe, where she begins to live her normal life from the moment she left (2015) again with apparently no memory of her time in the Marvel Universe, which she hates. Gwen is drawn to a machine in a sleep study she volunteered for that could get her back to the Marvel Universe. Gwen is stopped from jumping into the vortex by her brother, who implies it's different to the way she originally entered the Marvel Universe, prompting her to reluctantly deactivate the machine and decide to go home. Then, while breaking the fourth wall and being confused by this, she sees a \"The End\" lying on the floor and picks it up before dropping and breaking it. It is then replaced by \"to be continued\" and a preview for #17, confusing Gwen.\n[4184506#5] Gwen Cooper - In 2008, as series two begins, Gwen has replaced Jack as team leader. When Jack returns to lead Torchwood, Gwen displays anger towards him for abandoning the team, and surprises him with the news she has become engaged. In a later episode she is forced to tell Rhys about her job at Torchwood when he assumes she is having an affair with Jack. After Rhys takes a bullet for her Gwen defies Jack by refusing to wipe Rhys' memories, feeling humbled by her partner's loyalty and bravery. In \"Something Borrowed\", despite being pregnant to an alien Nostrovite, Gwen refuses to postpone the wedding to Rhys. Her marriage makes Jack remember an earlier marriage of his own. In \"Adrift\" Rhys continues to push Gwen to unburden herself from her traumatic experiences, after her attempt to re-unite families with missing children stolen by the rift goes horribly wrong. In the series finale, Gwen's leadership skills allow her to co-ordinate Cardiff during the chaos caused by Captain John Hart (James Marsters) and Jack's younger brother Gray (Lachlan Nieboer). When Gray kills Gwen's teammates Toshiko (Naoko Mori) and Owen, Gwen is desolate. The character makes a crossover appearance in \"Doctor Who\" alongside Jack and Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) in its 2008 series' two-part finale, in which Torchwood help contact series protagonist the Doctor (David Tennant) during an invasion of the psychopathic mutant Daleks, and later must defend their headquarters from the attacking aliens. The Doctor suggests a connection to Gwyneth, a separate character portrayed by Eve Myles in the 2005 \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Unquiet Dead\".\n[50994304#1] Gwenpool - Marvel initially produced two stories featuring Gwenpool as a character, a backup story in the series \"Howard the Duck\", and a one-shot \"Gwenpool Holiday Special\". A retcon in the \"Howard the Duck\" #1 backup revealed her name to actually be \"Gwen Poole.\" Following the publication of the one-shot, an ongoing series titled \"The Unbelievable Gwenpool\" by the same creative team was announced, which started in April 2016. \"The Unbelievable Gwenpool\" #0, collecting Poole's appearances from \"Howard the Duck\" and the first \"Gwenpool Holiday Special\", was later released.\n[7693584#2] List of Torchwood characters - Gwen Cooper, played by Welsh actress Eve Myles, was recruited into Torchwood Three in the series premiere \"Everything Changes\". A policewoman, partnered with PC Andy Davidson, Gwen by the second series becomes elevated to the team's second-in-command, after serving as leader during Jack's absence. Despite their relationship being tested by Gwen's dishonesty, feelings for Jack Harkness and a tempestuous affair with Owen Harper, Gwen and her live-in boyfriend Rhys eventually get married. Gwen is one of two surviving agents following the destruction of the Cardiff branch of the Torchwood Institute, and goes into hiding following the birth of daughter Anwen. During Miracle Day she is conflicted between her Torchwood duties and her responsibility to her baby daughter and severely ill father.\n[50994304#0] Gwenpool - Gwendolyn \"Gwen\" Poole is a fictional character who appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, originating as an amalgam of Gwen Stacy and Deadpool on a variant cover of \"Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars\" #2, one of twenty variant covers published due to the popularity of Spider-Gwen from June 2015.\n[4184506#7] Gwen Cooper - Fourth series \"\" (2011), an American co-production, re-establishes Gwen, Rhys and their daughter Anwen living reclusively in rural Wales. CIA agent Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer) renditions Gwen to the United States, believing a worldwide phenomenon wherein no one can die to be connected to Torchwood and she becomes part of a new Torchwood team alongside Jack, Rex and former CIA analyst Esther Drummond (Alexa Havins). In \"The Categories of Life\" and \"The Middle Men\" Gwen returns to Wales to rescue her ailing father Geraint (William Thomas), who survived a fatal heart attack on \"Miracle Day\", from a facility where the critically injured are incinerated. Upon her return to America her family are kidnapped as leverage to make her surrender Jack. Gwen tells Jack, now ostensibly mortal, that she would allow him to be killed to save Anwen. After Gwen is deported by senior CIA official Allen Shapiro (John De Lancie) because of her dissidence she focusses on protecting her father from the authorities; enclosing him in her mother Mary's (Sharon Morgan) cellar and supplying him with palliative medicine. The concluding episode, \"The Blood Line\" opens with Gwen eulogising her father as the kindest man she has ever known, before stating that she is about to kill him. When the power and profit driven conspirators behind Miracle Day try to thwart her resolve by wounding Esther, Gwen declares she will sacrifice her entire Torchwood team to restore order. She shoots Jack through the heart, allowing his unique blood to prompt an ancient phenomenon to reset the human morphic field. As Geraint and other \"Miracle Day\" survivors pass away peacefully, Jack's immortality is restored. Gwen is shocked to discover at Esther's funeral that Rex is now immortal too.\n[7424489#1] Everything Changes (Torchwood) - The story is told from the perspective of Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), who comes across the Torchwood team through her job as a police officer with the South Wales Police, who are investigating a series of strange deaths in Cardiff. Through Gwen's discovery of Torchwood, the audience are introduced to team members Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd). Suzie Costello, as played by Indira Varma, had also been billed as a series regular prior to transmission, though in a twist the character was revealed as the murderer and killed off at the end of the episode, with Gwen replacing her as a member of the Torchwood team.\n[4184506#20] Gwen Cooper - Much of Gwen's characterisation centers on her developing relationship with her partner Rhys. Eve Myles describes the character as Gwen's \"normality base\". The relationship is tested by Gwen's affair with colleague Owen Harper (Gorman), a betrayal which Myles believes to be \"completely out of character\" for Gwen, explaining that the guilt experienced over her actions tears her to pieces. The production team had originally planned for Rhys to die in the first series but he was given a reprieve. Producer Richard Stokes explains that Rhys' presence keeps Gwen from losing her \"heart\" and that without him \"it simply becomes a sci-fi show about sci-fi people, running around and hunting aliens\". Julie Gardner adds that in the discussion, the writers had felt they could not have written Gwen as ever recovering from Rhys' loss, and so chose not to kill off the character. In his analysis of Gwen, Daniel Rawcliffe opines that Rhys helps to keep her mental health intact, and argues that his presence prevents her from undergoing the same psychological deterioration as Suzie.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When were the Knights Templar formed?\n\nContexts: [16869#7] Knights Templar - Although the primary mission of the order was militaristic, relatively few members were combatants. The others acted in support positions to assist the knights and to manage the financial infrastructure. The Templar Order, though its members were sworn to individual poverty, was given control of wealth beyond direct donations. A nobleman who was interested in participating in the Crusades might place all his assets under Templar management while he was away. Accumulating wealth in this manner throughout Christendom and the Outremer, the order in 1150 began generating letters of credit for pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land: pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value. This innovative arrangement was an early form of banking and may have been the first formal system to support the use of cheques; it improved the safety of pilgrims by making them less attractive targets for thieves, and also contributed to the Templar coffers.\n[16869#27] Knights Templar - The knights wore a white surcoat with a red cross, and a white mantle also with a red cross; the sergeants wore a black tunic with a red cross on the front and a black or brown mantle. The white mantle was assigned to the Templars at the Council of Troyes in 1129, and the cross was most probably added to their robes at the launch of the Second Crusade in 1147, when Pope Eugenius III, King Louis VII of France, and many other notables attended a meeting of the French Templars at their headquarters near Paris. Under the Rule, the knights were to wear the white mantle at all times: they were even forbidden to eat or drink unless wearing it.\n[189692#5] Baphomet - When the medieval order of the Knights Templar was suppressed by King Philip IV of France, on Friday 13 October 1307, Philip had many French Templars simultaneously arrested, and then tortured into confessions. Over 100 different charges had been leveled against the Templars. Most of them were dubious, as they were the same charges that were leveled against the Cathars and many of King Philip's enemies; he had earlier kidnapped Pope Boniface VIII and charged him with near identical offenses of heresy, spitting and urinating on the cross, and sodomy. Yet Malcolm Barber observes that historians \"find it difficult to accept that an affair of such enormity rests upon total fabrication\". The \"Chinon Parchment suggests that the Templars did indeed spit on the cross,\" says Sean Martin, and that these acts were intended to simulate the kind of humiliation and torture that a Crusader might be subjected to if captured by the Saracens, where they were taught how to commit apostasy \"with the mind only and not with the heart\". Similarly, Michael Haag suggests that the simulated worship of Baphomet did indeed form part of a Templar initiation ritual.\n[16869#5] Knights Templar - The impoverished status of the Templars did not last long. They had a powerful advocate in Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, a leading Church figure, the French abbot primarily responsible for the founding of the Cistercian Order of monks and a nephew of André de Montbard, one of the founding knights. Bernard put his weight behind them and wrote persuasively on their behalf in the letter 'In Praise of the New Knighthood', and in 1129, at the Council of Troyes, he led a group of leading churchmen to officially approve and endorse the order on behalf of the church. With this formal blessing, the Templars became a favoured charity throughout Christendom, receiving money, land, businesses, and noble-born sons from families who were eager to help with the fight in the Holy Land. Another major benefit came in 1139, when Pope Innocent II's papal bull \"Omne Datum Optimum\" exempted the order from obedience to local laws. This ruling meant that the Templars could pass freely through all borders, were not required to pay any taxes, and were exempt from all authority except that of the pope.\n[17416992#50] Military history of the Crusader states - Some military orders may have fought on foot as dismounted knights. This would have been favorable in circumstances were the ground was difficult or else too narrow for large numbers of cavalry. However, in the open desert plains of the Middle East, it would have been foolish to travel on foot.The Templar Knights were created in 1119 when King Baldwin II gave permission for eight knights to start a new military order to protect pilgrims on their way to the Holy land. They never retreated from battle and as a result, only a tenth of the Templars survived battle. The Order had to constantly spend large sums of money recruiting new knights. Over time, The Templars grew to an impressive order of thousands of members, though not all would have been heavy cavalry – most would have been squires or servants accompanying the Knights. The Templars participated in almost every major battle of the Second Crusade onwards. They were later betrayed and disbanded by a combination of the French crown and the papacy.\n[16869#9] Knights Templar - In the mid-12th century, the tide began to turn in the Crusades. The Muslim world had become more united under effective leaders such as Saladin. Dissension arose among Christian factions in and concerning the Holy Land. The Knights Templar were occasionally at odds with the two other Christian military orders, the Knights Hospitaller and the Teutonic Knights, and decades of internecine feuds weakened Christian positions, both politically and militarily. After the Templars were involved in several unsuccessful campaigns, including the pivotal Battle of Hattin, Jerusalem was recaptured by Muslim forces under Saladin in 1187. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II reclaimed the city for Christians in the Sixth Crusade of 1229, without Templar aid, but only held it briefly for a little more than a decade. In 1244, the Ayyubid dynasty together with Khwarezmi mercenaries recaptured Jerusalem, and the city did not return to Western control until 1917 when, during World War I, the British captured it from the Ottoman Empire.\n[4040841#14] Knights Templar (Freemasonry) - The original medieval Order of Knights Templar was established after the First Crusade, and existed from approximately 1118 to 1312. There is no known historical evidence to link the medieval Knights Templar and Masonic Templarism, nor do the Masonic Knights Templar organizations claim any such direct link to the original medieval Templar organization. Though it has been said that its affiliation with Masonry is based on texts that indicate persecuted Templars found refuge within the safety of Freemasonry, the order itself states that \"there is no proof of direct connection between the ancient order and the modern order known today as the Knights Templar.\" The official motto of the Knights Templar is In Hoc Signo Vinces, the rendition in Latin of the Greek phrase \"εν τούτῳ νίκα\", en toutōi nika, meaning \"in this [sign] you will conquer\".\n[20648590#17] Trials of the Knights Templar - On September 13, 1309, two Inquisitors were brought to England and allowed to question the Templars but in the presence of English prelates and as of November 1309, none of the Templars would confess to the charges. At that time torture was rarely used in England, while the legal system was well-formed and used regular jurors as opposed to the \"professional witness, accusers and jurors\" frequently used by Philip as tools to enforce his will. In December, the Pope put pressure on England and other countries to allow the Inquisitors to use \"their\" methods, namely \"torture\", and reluctant approval was given by the King of England. The conditions that the Templars were living in were radically changed and, as with continued pressure by the Pope and Inquisition on the King and local prelates, the inevitable result was obtained. The English Templars were sent to the Count of Ponthieu which did not adhere to English Law. Various confessions, different in many ways, were nonetheless obtained and the Templars were either executed or sent to prison for life.\n[26589451#3] Ralph de Sudeley - “When the Knights Templar order was founded in France in the early 1100s, its members were French Cistercian monks who vowed to fight for Christianity in the Holy Land. Within fifty years, however, men from other European countries such as Germany and England joined the ranks, and many of these were far from being monks. Most were either professional soldiers or simply adventurers whose motives were a combination of glory and greed. (Rich pickings were to be had from plundering the Moslem population of the Middle East.) Although the Knights Templar order still considered itself to be an army of holy warriors, by the 1180s it was more like an early version of the Foreign Legion: an international militia under French control that made up its numbers with mercenaries and adventurers. One such adventurer was Ralph de Sudeley, the leader of the Templars who apparently found the treasure at Jebel Madhbah in the 1180s. He was a wealthy English knight who joined the Templars in the Holy Land in 1182, and in 1189 he returned to his home at Herdewyke (now called Temple Herdewyke) in the county of Warwickshire in central England, only ten miles from what would later be Shakespeare’s birthplace of Stratford-upon-Avon.\n[4040841#4] Knights Templar (Freemasonry) - In 1779 the High Knights Templar of Ireland Lodge, Kilwinning, obtained a charter from Lodge Mother Kilwinning in Scotland. This lodge now began to grant dispensations to other lodges to confer the Knights Templar Degree. Some time around 1790 the Early Grand Encampment of Ireland was formed, which began to warrant Templar Lodges, and evolved into the Supreme Grand Encampment in 1836. The Early Grand Encampment chartered several Scottish \"encampments\" one of which, having been chartered in 1805 as the \"Edinburgh Encampment No. 31\", then became the\"Grand Assembly of Knights Templar in Edinburgh\". who then sought a charter from the Duke of Kent, Grand Master of the Order in England. It seems that the Templar degree had filtered into the lodges of the Antients from Ireland about 1780, and was recorded at York about the same time. In the five degree system developed by the York Masons, the Knights Templar degree sat between the Master Mason and the Sublime Degree of Royal Arch.\nTemplar masonry in England entered a new era in 1791, with the formation of its first Grand Conclave, with Thomas Dunckerley as Grand Master. At that time, there were eight known Templar encampments in England, the most senior being the Encampment of Redemption at York, and the Baldwyn encampment at Bristol, at whose request Dunckerley began his mission. Under his leadership, the number of encampments steadily grew until his death in 1795. Stasis then followed, until in 1805 their Royal Patron, Duke of Kent, became Grand Master himself, re-energising the society and launching it into an era of growth and development. Dunckerley laid the foundation for this not only by promoting the order, but by standardising the ritual and insisting on proper record keeping. The Grand Conclave went into a period of decline between 1872 and 1895, when it was re-founded as the present day Great Priory of England and Wales.\n[16869#0] Knights Templar - The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon (), also known as the Order of Solomon's Temple, the Knights Templar or simply the Templars, were a Catholic military order recognised in 1139 by the papal bull \"Omne datum optimum\". The order was founded in 1119 and was active until about 1312.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Is Jor-El Superman's dad?\n\nContexts: [12108230#27] Superman in film - Turning in his script in July 2002, J. J. Abrams' \"Superman: Flyby\" was an origin story that included Krypton besieged by a civil war between Jor-El and his corrupt brother Kata-Zor. Before Kata-Zor sentences Jor-El to prison, Kal-El is launched to Earth to fulfill a prophecy. Adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent, he forms a romance with Lois Lane in the \"Daily Planet\". However, Lois is more concerned with exposing Lex Luthor, written as a government agent obsessed with UFO phenomena. Clark reveals himself to the world as Superman, bringing Kata-Zor's son, Ty-Zor, and three other Kryptonians to Earth. Superman is defeated and killed, and visits Jor-El (who committed suicide on Krypton while in prison) in Kryptonian heaven. Resurrected, he returns to Earth and defeats the four Kryptonians. The script ends with Superman flying off to Krypton in a spaceship.\n[5483121#6] For the Man Who Has Everything - While Wonder Woman battles Mongul, whose power and strength exceed hers, Batman and Robin try to free Superman. Meanwhile, Superman's fantasy takes a dark turn. His father Jor-El's prediction of Krypton's doom was unfulfilled, leading to Jor-El being discredited and embittered. Superman's mother Lara has died from the \"Eating Sickness\", which has further isolated Jor-El from his son and the rest of his family. Even the death of his brother Zor-El has not reconciled him to his sister-in-law Alura and niece Kara Zor-El.\n[49655774#1] Superman: The Last Family of Krypton - Jor-El hires Lex Luthor to work at JorCorp, but Luthor eventually attempts a complex plan to destroy Jor-El's reputation with the aid of his reprogrammed A.I. B, feeling that Jor-El is nothing more than a megalomaniac with a superbrain and a god complex who would always undermine his accomplishments. After Luthor's plan turns Bru-El against his family as a kryptonite-powered superhuman, Bru-El nearly kills his father before Lara sacrifices herself to save her husband, Kal-El managing to defeat his brother after he expends so much of his kryptonite energy in the early attack. Recognising the flaws in his past actions, Jor-El steps back from the public eye, becoming a simple wanderer of Earth and other planets, while allowing Kal-El to act as the official hero as Superman.\n[514505#5] Jor-El - Jor-El was first referred to indirectly in \"Action Comics\" #1 in 1938, which only mentioned a scientist who sends his son to Earth. He made his first full-fledged appearance in the \"Superman\" newspaper comic strip in 1939, where his name was spelled as \"Jor-L\". His name first appeared as being spelled \"Jor-el\" in the \"Superman\" novel \"The Adventures of Superman\" (1942) written by George Lowther. Later comic books capitalized the \"E\" in \"El.\" Jor-El's first appearance in an actual comic book was in \"More Fun Comics\" #101. After the introduction of DC Comics' multiverse system in the 1960s, it was established that the version of Superman's father during the Golden Age of Comic Books was named \"Jor-L\", and he lived on the Krypton of the Earth-Two universe. However, \"Jor-El\" was the father of the Silver Age version of Superman, and he lived on the Krypton of the Earth-One universe.\n[720155#18] Doctor Manhattan - Manhattan puts Bruce Wayne in contact with the \"Flashpoint\" Thomas Wayne, who tells his son to not become Batman before his \"death\" and the destruction of the last of the \"Flashpoint\" timeline, prompting Bruce to not respond to the Bat-Signal the following night. Manhattan also saves Jor-El from the destruction of Krypton, before conditioning him to see only the very worst of humanity. Jor-El assumes the identity of Mister Oz and tries to convince his son Kal-El, or Superman, to abandon Earth. However, when Jor-El begins to realize that he has been pushing against his son too far, he is pulled away. Superman acknowledges Jor-El's warnings even as he rejects his misanthropy.\n[4688929#2] Kryptonopolis - Kryptonopolis is also the home of Jor-El and Lara, the parents of Kal-El. When Jor-El's researches discover that Krypton is fated to explode, Jor-El constructs an escape rocket for his young son. Jor-El launches Kal-El (the future Superman) into space shortly before the destruction of Krypton. Kryptonopolis is also destroyed in the explosion.\n[514505#1] Jor-El - A Kryptonian, Jor-El is Superman's (birth name Kal-El) biological father, the husband of Lara, and a leading scientist on the planet Krypton before its destruction. He foresaw the planet's fate but was unable to convince his colleagues in time to save the inhabitants. Jor-El was able to save his infant son Kal-El (Superman) by sending him in a homemade spaceship towards Earth just moments before Krypton exploded. After constructing his Fortress of Solitude, Superman honored his biological parents with a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a globe of Krypton.\n[514505#15] Jor-El - In the 2004 miniseries \"\", Jor-El, along with Krypton and Lara, was, more or less, reinstated to his Silver Age versions, though with such updated touches as Lara contributing equally to the effort of sending Kal-El, once again an infant while on Krypton, to Earth. In this version, Jor-El discovers Earth moments before launching his son's spacecraft. Also, the conclusion of the miniseries has the adult Superman, on Earth, seeing his parents through Lex Luthor's time-space communicator, and on Krypton, seconds before its destruction, Jor-El and Lara see their son alive and well on Earth and know that their efforts were successful. As with Byrne's conflicting view of Krypton, the \"Birthright\" origins of Jor-El, Krypton, and Luthor have recently been retconned, and, following \"Infinite Crisis\", they are no longer valid in comics canon.\n[3513216#19] Publication history of Superman - In the version that became established by the early 1960s (and memorably summarized at the start of each episode of the 1950s \"Adventures of Superman\" television series), Superman is born on Krypton as Kal-El, the son of Jor-El (a leader-scientist) and Lara. When Kal-El is two or three years-old, Jor-El learns that Krypton is doomed to explode. He brings this warning to the Science Council, Krypton's rulers. The Science Council refuses to warn their fellow Kryptonians and forbids Jor-El to do so. Jor-El immediately begins work on a rocket that will allow the whole family to escape the coming disaster; however, events move too quickly, and only a small model is completed by the time of the final quakes. Lara stays by her husband's side rather than accompany Kal-El to Earth so that his ship will have a better chance of surviving the trip. Knowing that Earth's lower gravity and yellow sun will give the boy extraordinary powers, Jor-El launches Kal-El's rocketship toward Earth moments before Krypton explodes.\n[12439158#5] Origin of Superman - Superman is born Kal-El on the alien planet Krypton. His parents, Jor-El and Lara become aware of Krypton's impending destruction and Jor-El begins constructing a spacecraft to carry Kal-El to Earth. During Krypton's last moments, Jor-El places young Kal-El in the spacecraft and launches it. Jor-El and Lara die as the spacecraft barely escapes Krypton's fate. The explosion transforms planetary debris into kryptonite, a radioactive substance that is lethal to superpowered (as by Earth's yellow sun) Kryptonians.\n[49655774#0] Superman: The Last Family of Krypton - Superman: The Last Family of Krypton is a comic book limited series, published in 2010. It depicts what could have happened if Superman's parents also arrived on Earth.\nJor-El was able to save himself and Lara and accompany Kal-El to Earth, where Jor-El sets up the corporation JorCorp while Lara establishes the self-help movement 'Raology'. Lara is willing to adapt to life on Earth, arranging for Kal-El to be discreetly adopted by the Kents so that he can live a more normal life, and later has twin children, Bru-El and Valora, whose 'stunted' genetics due to their birth on Earth mean that they only possess half of the superhuman potential of their brother. BY contrast, Jor-El is particularly focused on scientific development above all else, even spending a large portion of his time in a chair that downloads information about Earth directly into his brain so that he can keep track of Earth's development in order to cut off any attempt to prevent a similar disaster befalling Earth as happened on Krypton. Although his actions hinder Earth by keeping humanity essentially dependent on him, Jor-El argues that Earth only needs his family to protect them, such as telling the Guardians of the Universe not to bother appointing a Green Lantern to Earth. While attending a dinner in Gotham, Lara is able to save Thomas and Martha Wayne when she intercepts Joe Chill's attempted mugging, thus unknowingly preventing the creation of Batman. Lara eventually rejects Jor-El's desire to 'micromanage' humanity, relocating to her own estate of 'Lara-Land', where she uses red sun emitters to restrict her natural abilities and simply encourages spiritual growth while using Kryptonian technology to heal injuries.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When was Tylenol introduced?\n\nContexts: [166826#43] Johnson &amp; Johnson - On September 29, 1982, a \"Tylenol scare\" began when the first of seven individuals died in Chicago metropolitan area, after ingesting Extra Strength Tylenol that had been deliberately laced with cyanide. Within a week, the company pulled 31 million bottles of capsules back from retailers, making it one of the first major recalls in American history. The incident led to reforms in the packaging of over-the-counter substances and to federal anti-tampering laws. The case remains unsolved and no suspects have been charged. Johnson & Johnson's quick response, including a nationwide recall, was widely praised by public relations experts and the media and was the gold standard for corporate crisis management.\n[83407#8] Tylenol (brand) - On January 15, 2010, Johnson & Johnson announced a voluntary recall of several hundred batches of popular medicines, including Benadryl, Motrin, Rolaids, Simply Sleep, St. Joseph Aspirin and Tylenol. The recall was due to complaints of a musty smell suspected to be due to contamination of the packaging with the chemical 2,4,6-tribromoanisole. The full health effects of 2,4,6-tribromoanisole are not known but no serious events have been documented in medical literature. The recall came 20 months after McNeil first began receiving and investigating consumer complaints about moldy-smelling bottles of Tylenol Arthritis Relief caplets, according to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The recall included 53 million bottles of over-the-counter products including Tylenol, Motrin and Rolaids, Benadryl and St. Joseph's Aspirin, involving lots in the Americas, the United Arab Emirates and Fiji.\n[83407#3] Tylenol (brand) - The brand was introduced in 1955 by McNeil Laboratories, a family owned pharmaceutical manufacturer. Two brothers took over the company from their father that year, and that year one of them learned about paracetamol, which was not on the US market at that time. To avoid competing with aspirin, they marketed it as a product to reduce fever in children, packaging it like a red fire truck with the slogan, \"for little hotheads\". The name \"Tylenol\" and the generic name \"acetaminophen\" were generated by McNeil from the chemical name of the drug. Johnson & Johnson bought McNeil in 1959, and one year later the drug was made available over the counter.\n[16283254#29] History of aspirin - However, Sterling Products did not market \"Panadol\" in the United States or other countries where \"Bayer Aspirin\" still dominated the aspirin market. Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, McNeil Laboratories with liquid \"Tylenol\" in 1955, and \"Tylenol\" pills in 1958. By 1967, \"Tylenol\" was available without a prescription. Because it did not cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: ibuprofen (sold as \"Brufen\" in the U.K. and \"Motrin\" in the U.S.). By the 1970s, aspirin had a relatively small portion of the pain reliever market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription.\n[83407#5] Tylenol (brand) - As a result of the crisis, all Tylenol capsules were discontinued, as were capsules of other brand names. Retained by McNeil's president, Joseph Chiesa, new product consultant Martin Calle of management strategist Calle & Company conceived the world's first tamper-resistant gelatin-enrobed capsule called \"Tylenol Gelcaps\", which proved to resuscitate the 92% of capsule-segment sales lost to the recall. The tamper-resistant, triple-sealed safety containers were placed on the shelves of retailers 10 weeks after the withdrawal, and other manufacturers followed suit. The crisis cost the company more than $100 million, but Tylenol regained 100% of the market share it had before the crisis. The Tylenol murderer was never found, and a $100,000 reward offered by Johnson & Johnson remains unclaimed.\n[83407#4] Tylenol (brand) - On September 29, 1982, a \"Tylenol scare\" began when the first of seven individuals died in the Chicago metropolitan area after ingesting Extra Strength Tylenol that had been deliberately contaminated with cyanide. Within a week, the company pulled 31 million bottles of tablets back from retailers, making it one of the first major product recalls in American history.\n[11293079#34] Burson-Marsteller - At a Burson-Marsteller organized press conference in November 1982, Johnson & Johnson introduced new tamper-proof packaging, becoming the first company to introduce triple-sealed packaging, which later became the industry standard. The conference gave Johnson & Johnson the opportunity to announce that they were reintroducing Tylenol capsules to the market and would replace any Tylenol that consumers had thrown away. In addition, Johnson & Johnson published advertisements with coupons for consumers to use in replacing Tylenol that had been thrown out and produced commercials and print advertisements thanking the public for their \"continuing confidence and support\". Within six weeks of the introduction of the repackaged product Tylenol's sales returned to the previous level. In 1983, Burson-Marsteller was awarded a Silver Anvil for \"out-of-the-ordinary crisis management\" for its work with Johnson & Johnson. The company was brought back to handle crisis management during a second Tylenol crisis, involving cyanide tainting in New York in 1986.\n[348268#47] Crisis management - In the fall of 1982, a murderer added 65 milligrams of cyanide to some Tylenol capsules on store shelves, killing seven people, including three in one family. Johnson & Johnson recalled and destroyed 31 million capsules at a cost of $100 million. The affable CEO, James Burke, appeared in television ads and at news conferences informing consumers of the company's actions. Tamper-resistant packaging was rapidly introduced, and Tylenol sales swiftly bounced back to near pre-crisis levels.\n[330675#5] Chicago Tylenol murders - In a concerted effort to reassure the public, Johnson & Johnson distributed warnings to hospitals and distributors and halted Tylenol production and advertising. On October 5, 1982, it issued a nationwide recall of Tylenol products; an estimated 31 million bottles were in circulation, with a retail value of over US $100 million ($267 million in 2018). The company also advertised in the national media for individuals not to consume any of its products that contained acetaminophen after it was determined that only these capsules had been tampered with. Johnson & Johnson offered to exchange all Tylenol capsules already purchased by the public for solid tablets.\n[11293079#33] Burson-Marsteller - Burson-Marsteller's handling of the Chicago Tylenol poisonings for Johnson & Johnson in September 1982 has been referred to as the \"gold standard\" for crisis management. Seven people in the Chicago area were killed when they took Tylenol capsules tainted with cyanide, and Johnson & Johnson went to Burson-Marsteller for advice on how to approach the situation. After an eighth death, which occurred in California, the response by Johnson & Johnson was to announce a nationwide recall of all Tylenol capsules. Burson-Marsteller organized a press conference televised across 35 markets in the United States, addressing the recall and reporting that the product tampering had occurred on the shelves, not during manufacturing. During late October 1982, a brief television campaign was undertaken asking for the public to trust Tylenol, and Burson-Marsteller carried out nationwide polling which found that the majority of the population still had confidence in Johnson & Johnson. Ninety percent of respondents stated that they did not hold the manufacturer responsible for the deaths.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

As a novice there, Arya attempts to master their belief that Faceless Men have no true identity by throwing all her treasures into the water (secretly keeping her sword, Needle) and posing as a girl called \"Cat of the Canals\". Her former identity asserts itself in the form of wolf dreams, and also when she kills Dareon, sworn brother of Samwell Tarly, for abandoning the Night's Watch. Having confessed this death, she is given a glass of warm milk as punishment.

After impressing Jaqen with her ability to lie undetected by convincing a terminally ill girl to drink poison, she is given the assignment of assassinating a corrupt insurance salesman. However, she is distracted from her mission by the arrival in Braavos of Ser Meryn Trant. Assuming the identity of the girl she had poisoned, Arya disguises herself as a prostitute and infiltrates a brothel, where she kills Meryn. However, when she returns to the House of Black and White she is caught by Jaqen, who chides that Arya has not dissociated from her identity and that as a result wearing another person's face will poison her. Arya is subsequently struck blind.\n[713590#8] A Clash of Kings - Arya Stark, posing as an orphan boy named Arry, is taken north by Yoren as a new recruit for the Night's Watch.

The survivors are taken to Harrenhal and put to work as servants in the undermanned castle. For saving his life during the attack, a man named Jaqen H'ghar promises to repay Arya by killing three men of her choice. For her three choices, Arya selects Chiswyck, a soldier in Gregor Clegane's forces, Weese, her servant overseer, and Jaqen H'ghar himself. The first two murders he carries out without question; in lieu of the third choice, Arya leverages H'ghar to help her slay the Lannister soldiers guarding Robett Glover, who had been taken prisoner by the Brave Companions. After Glover is freed, the Brave Companions turn their cloaks and join with the North. H'ghar gives Arya a mysterious iron coin and tells her to find him in Braavos if she should ever desire to learn his secrets. He then adopts a new identity and leaves. Control of Harrenhal is ceded to Roose Bolton, whom Arya serves as cupbearer, but soon escapes.\n[46631848#3] The Dance of Dragons - Arya, still in the disguise of an oyster vendor, continues the mission given to her by Jaqen to poison and kill the Thin Man. However, as she is on the way to her target, she sees Mace Tyrell and Meryn Trant arrive in the harbor to negotiate payment terms with the Iron Bank. Arya, recognising Trant, ignores her mission and follows Mace and Trant into the city. She eventually tracks Trant to a brothel, where she learns that he is sexually attracted to pubescent girls. Upon returning to Jaqen, Arya lies to him by telling him the Thin Man was not hungry and did not buy her oysters, and asks to try again the next day. Jaqen allows this, though it is unclear whether he believes Arya or not.\n[41374178#19] Arya Stark - The recruits are attacked by Lannister soldiers under Ser Amory Lorch, who have been ordered by Cersei Lannister to kill Robert Baratheon's bastard Gendry, who is part of the party. Needle is confiscated by a soldier, Polliver, who then uses it to kill Arya's friend Lommy Greenhands (who Arya later claims is Gendry). The recruits are taken to Harrenhal, where Tywin Lannister recognises her as a girl and takes her as his cupbearer. Jaqen offers to kill three people for Arya as reward for saving his life and those of his cellmates during the attack; Arya picks Harrenhal's torturer The Tickler and Ser Amory. When Arya is unable to have Tywin killed before his departure, she has Jaqen help her, Gendry and her friend Hot Pie escape. Jaqen offers to take Arya to Braavos to join the Faceless Men assassin guild, and although she declines he gives her an iron coin that will allow her to obtain passage to Braavos.\n[41374178#15] Arya Stark - After skinchanging into a stray tomcat that followed her back to the temple, Arya is able to identify the Kindly Man as the person who sneak-attacks her with a stick every night and later surprise-hits him. For this achievement, she passes the test and regains her vision, and is given her first assassination assignment. When she successfully poisons a crooked insurance salesman without rousing any suspicion or collateral damage, the Kindly Man gives Arya an acolyte's robe and assigns her to begin her first apprenticeship inserted within a theatrical group.\n[57098416#1] Gaurav Arya - In 1993, Arya started his training at the Officers Training Academy and was commissioned into the 17th Battalion, Kumaon Regiment on 5 March 1994. In 1999, due to a medical issue he retired from the Indian Army as a major. After leaving the army he did various jobs and got a Master of Business Administration degree. At present, Arya is a journalist with Republic TV specialising in defence and producing content related to the Indian security forces in various parts of the nation.\n[2202702#7] A Dance with Dragons - In Braavos, Arya is an acolyte of the guild of assassins known as the Faceless Men. Temporarily afflicted with blindness at their hands, she develops her sense of hearing, and realizes that she can \"see\" through cats the same way she could with her pet direwolf, Nymeria. After successfully fending off an attack by the master of the temple with a stick sword, Arya's sight is restored. She is magically given the face of one of the temple petitioners, who come there seeking a quiet death, and is tasked with assassinating a corrupt merchant. After doing so, Arya is declared an apprentice of the Faceless Men, to be sent to another assassin to continue her training.\n[35888445#10] Valar Morghulis - Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie flee from Harrenhal. They are surprised by the sudden appearance of the mysterious assassin Jaqen H'ghar, who helped them escape. Jaqen offers to take Arya with him to Braavos to train her in his abilities. Although tempted, Arya declines, intending to reunite with her family. Before departing, Jaqen hands Arya a special coin and the phrase \"\"Valar morghulis\",\" which Arya may use to seek him if she meets anyone from Braavos. Before departing, Jaqen turns to reveal he has changed his face, an ability of the \"Faceless Men\" he mentions to Arya.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What were the Egyptian pyramids used for?\n\nContexts: [56695079#6] Ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs - The Pyramid Texts were the first religious spells to be carved into the walls of royal ancient Egyptian pyramids. Beginning in the Old Kingdom period, these texts were used exclusively by the Egyptian pharaohs to decorate the walls of their tombs. However, Egyptian Queens and high-ranking government officials soon began to use Pyramid Texts in their burial tombs as well. The purpose of these texts were to help the pharaoh successfully complete his journey through the afterlife, by conveying knowledge to the deceased about the paths he should take and the dangers he might face along the way.\n[826340#9] Pyramid of Cestius - Some writers have questioned whether the Roman pyramids were modelled on the much less steeply pointed Egyptian pyramids exemplified by the famous pyramids of Giza. However, the relatively shallow Giza-type pyramids were not exclusively used by the Egyptians; steeper pyramids of the Nubian type were favoured by the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt that had been brought to an end in the Roman conquest of 30 BC. The pyramid was, in any case, built during a period when Rome was going through a fad for all things Egyptian. The Circus Maximus was adorned by Augustus with an Egyptian obelisk, and pyramids were built elsewhere in the Roman Empire around this time; the Falicon pyramid near Nice in France was suspected by some to have been constructed by Roman legionaries who followed an Egyptian cult, but more recent research has indicated that it was actually built between 1803 and 1812.\n[44330919#69] Ben Carson 2016 presidential campaign - In 2015, Carson reiterated his views on the Egyptian pyramids. Archaeologists reject the notion that the pyramids were used to store grain, noting that the pyramids were not hollow, ancient Egyptian granaries have been well-studied, there is evidence of burials inside the pyramids, and the ancient Egyptians left funerary instructions inside them. Additionally, the Bible states that Joseph's grain was kept in cities.\n[13088#36] Granite - The Red Pyramid of Egypt (c. 26th century BC), named for the light crimson hue of its exposed limestone surfaces, is the third largest of Egyptian pyramids. Menkaure's Pyramid, likely dating to the same era, was constructed of limestone and granite blocks. The Great Pyramid of Giza (c. 2580 BC) contains a huge granite sarcophagus fashioned of \"Red Aswan Granite\". The mostly ruined Black Pyramid dating from the reign of Amenemhat III once had a polished granite pyramidion or capstone, which is now on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (see Dahshur). Other uses in Ancient Egypt include columns, door lintels, sills, jambs, and wall and floor veneer. How the Egyptians worked the solid granite is still a matter of debate. Patrick Hunt has postulated that the Egyptians used emery, which has greater hardness on the Mohs scale.\n[864667#4] Egyptian pyramids - The second historically-documented Egyptian pyramid is attributed to the architect Imhotep, who planned what Egyptologists believe to be a tomb for the pharaoh Djoser. Imhotep is credited with being the first to conceive the notion of stacking mastabas on top of each other, creating an edifice composed of a number of \"steps\" that decreased in size towards its apex. The result was the Pyramid of Djoser, which was designed to serve as a gigantic stairway by which the soul of the deceased pharaoh could ascend to the heavens. Such was the importance of Imhotep's achievement that he was deified by later Egyptians.\n[864667#40] Egyptian pyramids - Constructing the pyramids involved moving huge quantities of stone. \nPapyri discovered at the Egyptian desert near the Red Sea, in 2013 by archaeologist Pierre Tallet, revealed the journal of Merer, an official of Egypt involved in transporting limestone along the Nile River. These papyri reveal processes in the building of the Great Pyramid at Giza, the tomb of the Pharaoh Khufu, just outside modern Cairo.\nRather than overland transport of the limestone used in building the pyramid, there is evidence that limestone blocks were transported along the Nile River, in the journal of Merer, preserved remnants of ancient canals, and transport boats discovered.\n[191325#15] Erich von Däniken - Erich von Däniken puts forward many beliefs about the Great Pyramid of Giza in his 1968 book Chariots of the Gods, saying that the ancient Egyptians did not have the most advanced tools to actually build the Pyramid, there is no evidence of workers, and there is too much 'intimate' knowledge about the Earth and its geography for the Egyptians to build the pyramid in that exact location. However, the technique of construction is well understood, the tools the Egyptians used are known, marks left in the quarries by those tools are still visible, and many examples of the tools are preserved in museums. Von Däniken claims that it would have taken the Egyptians too long to cut all the blocks necessary and drag them to the construction site in time to build the Great Pyramid in only 20 years; but a Nova documentary demonstrates how quickly a block of stone can be cut with the available tools and shows examples of the rollers used in their transportation. von Däniken also said that there were too many problems with their tools, and, according to him, the Egyptians had no prehistory so they could not have possibly built these large pyramids, even though there are pyramids in Egypt that were built before the Great Pyramid. Because he believed that there was no prehistory, von Däniken put forward that there is nothing known about how, when, or why these pyramids were built. Von Däniken also claims that Egyptians built perfect pyramids from the beginning, but numerous pyramid precursors survive, showing the errors made, and corrected, by Egyptian architects while they were perfecting the technique. These include simple mastabas, the Step Pyramid of Djoser, and the so-called Bent Pyramid. Not only that, but in his book, he says that there is no evidence of Egyptian workers so they had to have outside help; however, archaeologists have found evidence of buildings that workers would have resided in. Not only that, but there are also bakeries and sewer systems that the workers had in their living areas as well. There are also tombs that the workers had been buried in as well, and some of the skeletons had been found to have medical care, which helps prove that the workers were well taken care of; because of this, they were most likely Egyptian or they might not have been as well taken care of if they were not native Egyptians. Von Däniken claims that the height of the Cheops pyramid multiplied by one million is the distance to the Sun. In fact the calculation produces a figure of only 91,000 miles. Not only that, but he notes that the Great Pyramid is located on the Median line, divides the continents, and that the Egyptians could not align the edges so perfectly to true North without advanced technology that only aliens could give them. Egyptian builders, however, knew of simple methods to find North via star observation. The ancient Egyptian astronomers and, possibly, farmers spent a lot of their time studying the stars because that helped them to know how much time had passed, which they needed to know so they knew when to begin planting their crops in order to have food. Modern day Egyptologists have found artifacts and drawings of an object called a merkhet, which enabled the ancient Egyptians to determine which way was North. They figured this out just based upon the North Star and also locate other stars when they came into alignment with the merkhet. von Däniken did note in his book that the Egyptians did have plenty of time to study the stars. The ancient Egyptians were incredibly aware of the passage of time because they knew how to study the stars, so they would not have needed outside forces such as von Däniken's ancient astronauts to help them understand the relationship between stars and time.\n[10331#45] Ancient Egyptian religion - The first Egyptian tombs were mastabas, rectangular brick structures where kings and nobles were entombed. Each of them contained a subterranean burial chamber and a separate, above ground chapel for mortuary rituals. In the Old Kingdom the mastaba developed into the pyramid, which symbolized the primeval mound of Egyptian myth. Pyramids were reserved for royalty, and were accompanied by large mortuary temples sitting at their base. Middle Kingdom pharaohs continued to build pyramids, but the popularity of mastabas waned. Increasingly, commoners with sufficient means were buried in rock-cut tombs with separate mortuary chapels nearby, an approach which was less vulnerable to tomb robbery. By the beginning of the New Kingdom even the pharaohs were buried in such tombs, and they continued to be used until the decline of the religion itself.\n[3245297#0] Egyptian pyramid construction techniques - Egyptian pyramid construction techniques are the controversial subject of many hypotheses. These techniques seem to have developed over time; later pyramids were not constructed in the same way as earlier ones. Most of the construction hypotheses are based on the belief that huge stones were carved from quarries with copper chisels, and these blocks were then dragged and lifted into position. Disagreements chiefly concern the methods used to move and place the stones.\n[864667#8] Egyptian pyramids - The shape of Egyptian pyramids is thought to represent the primordial mound from which the Egyptians believed the earth was created. The shape of a pyramid is thought to be representative of the descending rays of the sun, and most pyramids were faced with polished, highly reflective white limestone, in order to give them a brilliant appearance when viewed from a distance. Pyramids were often also named in ways that referred to solar luminescence. For example, the formal name of the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur was \"The Southern Shining Pyramid\", and that of Senwosret at el-Lahun was \"Senwosret is Shining\".\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Who was the first owner of the Brooklyn Nets?\n\nContexts: [2294065#4] Bruce Ratner - Ratner first became owner of the Nets when he headed an ownership group that purchased the franchise from YankeeNets for $300 million. Ratner's group beat out an ownership group led by Charles Kushner and former New Jersey governor Jon Corzine. Ratner relocated the Nets to New York City, specifically to build an arena in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn even though there was desire to keep them in New Jersey and strong neighborhood protests to keep them out of Brooklyn.\n[1313676#27] Mikhail Prokhorov - He became the first non-North American team owner in the NBA. In December 2011, after announcing his run for the Russian presidency, the NBA confirmed that Prokhorov's ownership interest would not need to be altered in the event of his election (Herb Kohl, a then sitting but since retired U.S. Senator, owned the Milwaukee Bucks at the time). On 30 April 2012, the Nets officially made the move to Brooklyn, rebranding themselves as the Brooklyn Nets.\n[72852#17] Brooklyn Nets - On September 24, 2009, Mikhail Prokhorov, Russia's third-richest man according to \"Forbes\", confirmed his intention to become majority owner of the Nets. Prokhorov sent an offer to the team owners requesting that the control shareholding of the basketball club be sold to his company, Onexim, for a symbolic price. In return, Prokhorov funded a loan for the construction of a $700 million arena in Brooklyn which was later named the Barclays Center, and attracted additional funds from Western banks. Prokhorov stated that he initiated the deal to help push Russian basketball to a new level of development. On May 11, 2010, following approval from the other owners of the NBA, Prokhorov had become a principal owner of the Nets.\n[72852#14] Brooklyn Nets - The original owner of the Nets franchise was trucking magnate Arthur J. Brown, who was the founder of the American Basketball Association team that was then known as the New Jersey Americans in 1967. The next year, Brown renamed the franchise to the New York Nets following a move to Long Island, and sold the team for $1.1 million to entrepreneur Roy Boe. Due to financial losses suffered while the team was in Long Island, Boe moved the team back to New Jersey in 1977 and sold the team a year later to a group of seven local businessmen led by Alan N. Cohen and Joseph Taub, who became known as the \"Secaucus Seven\".\n[6250773#12] Sports in Brooklyn - On January 23, 2004, developer Bruce Ratner announced that he had purchased the National Basketball Association's Nets franchise (then known as the New Jersey Nets) and started on his plan to move the Nets to the 18,000-seat Barclays Center as part of the Atlantic Yards development at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues. After years of delays caused by community opposition and financial difficulties, the arena broke ground in March 2010 and opened in September 2012. The Nets officially changed their names to the Brooklyn Nets on April 30, 2012, and the move was made official. The Nets thus became Brooklyn's first major league sports team in 55 years.\n[44025962#58] History of the Brooklyn Nets - Riding a strong second half of the season from Deron Williams, the Nets clinched their first playoff berth since the 2006–07 season on March 21, 2013. On April 3, 2013, Brooklyn ended an eight-game road trip by beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 113–95 for the team's 21st road win, clinching the first winning season on the road in the franchise's NBA history. Brooklyn played its first ever playoff series in the borough versus the Chicago Bulls. After defeating the undermanned Bulls in a blowout in Game 1, the Nets then proceeded to lose Games 2 and 3 before giving up a 17-point lead in the final minutes of the fourth quarter in Game 4 and losing in overtime. The Nets won the next two games, only to lose Game 7 in Brooklyn. With the season over, the Nets announced that Carlesimo would not return as head coach.\n[44025962#54] History of the Brooklyn Nets - In 2004, after failing to secure a deal for a new arena in Newark, New Jersey (eventually a new arena, the Prudential Center, was built in Newark for the New Jersey Devils), the YankeeNets sold the franchise to a group headed by real estate developer Bruce Ratner for $300 million, beating out a group led by Charles Kushner and Jon Corzine. While Kushner and Corzine wanted to keep the Nets in New Jersey, Ratner planned to move the team back to New York. In 2005, the Nets announced plans to locate the team in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. One of the members of the ownership group at the time was rapper and Brooklyn native Jay-Z, who owned less than 0.07% but has been an outspoken face of the ownership team. The new arena, later named Barclays Center, would be the center of an extensive redevelopment project called the Atlantic Yards being constructed by Ratner's real estate development company. The new arena is located across the street from the site that Walter O'Malley wanted to use for a new stadium for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the early 1950s. That plan was rejected and resulted in the team's relocation to Los Angeles in 1958. The Nets would not only return to New York for the first time since 1977 but also became the first major professional sports team to play home games in Brooklyn since the departure of the Dodgers.\n[44025962#55] History of the Brooklyn Nets - After the dismissal of major pending lawsuits, groundbreaking for Barclays Center occurred on March 11, 2010.\nOn September 26, 2011, Jay-Z, the Nets' minority owner, announced that the team's new name after the move to Brooklyn would be the Brooklyn Nets. The team officially became the Brooklyn Nets on April 30, 2012. The team's new colors were announced to be black and white, and two official logos designed by Timothy Morris were unveiled. The primary logo is a shield depicting the team name 'Nets', along with a basketball with an overlaid \"B\". The secondary logo is the same \"B-ball\" surrounded by a black circle with the text \"Brooklyn\" and \"New York\". The new logo's typeface and colors are meant to evoke New York City Subway rollsigns from the 1950s when Brooklyn last had a major league sports team. This rebranding of the team led to a dramatic increase in merchandise sales for the team. On the first two days that the new merchandise was available, total sales from the NBA Store were 10 times that of a typical year when the team was in New Jersey, and in the initial months of the 2012–13 season, the Nets led all NBA teams in apparel sales.\n[19353300#0] List of Brooklyn Nets head coaches - The Brooklyn Nets are an American professional basketball team based in Brooklyn, New York. They are a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team plays its home games at the Barclays Center. The franchise was founded as the New Jersey Americans in 1967, and was one of the eleven original American Basketball Association (ABA) teams. In its second ABA season, Arthur Brown, the team owner, moved the team to Long Island and renamed it the New York Nets. The team won ABA championships in 1974 and 1976. When the ABA merged with the NBA in 1976, the Nets were one of four ABA teams admitted into the NBA. The team was moved to the Rutgers Athletic Center in New Jersey; after the 1976–77 NBA season, the team was renamed the New Jersey Nets. Since they joined the NBA, the Nets have won 4 divisional championships, 2 conference championships and appeared in the playoffs 16 times. The Nets moved to Brooklyn in 2012, and now play as the Brooklyn Nets.\n[72852#13] Brooklyn Nets - The Nets' front office in 2016 included Mikhail Prokhorov (principal owner), Brett Yormark (CEO), Sean Marks (general manager), and Jeff Gewirtz (executive vice president, business affairs & chief legal officer).\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: How tall is the African elephant?\n\nContexts: [9279#16] Elephant - Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. African bush elephants are the largest species, with males typically being tall at the shoulder and while females stand tall at the shoulder with a body mass of . Male Asian elephants are usually about tall at the shoulder and whereas females are tall at the shoulder and . African forest elephants are the smallest species, usually being around tall at the shoulder and . Male African elephants are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male Asian elephants are only around 15% taller than females. The skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326–351 bones. The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.\n[326177#4] African forest elephant - A male African forest elephant rarely exceeds 2.5 m (8.2 ft) in height, considerably smaller than the bush species which is usually over 3 m (9.8 ft) and sometimes almost 4 m (13.1 ft) tall. \"L. cyclotis\" reportedly weighs around , with the largest specimens attaining . Pygmy elephants of the Congo Basin, presumed to be a subgroup of \"L. cyclotis\", have reportedly weighed as little as as adults.\n[12784278#1] North African elephant - Carthaginian frescoes and coins minted by whoever controlled North Africa at various times show very small elephants, perhaps at the shoulder, with the large ears and concave back typical of modern African elephants. The North African elephant was smaller than the modern African bush elephant (\"L. a. africana\"), probably similar in size to the modern African forest elephant (\"L. cyclotis\"). It is also possible that it was more docile and plainer than the African bush elephant, which is generally untamable, allowing the Punics to tame it as a war elephant by a method now lost to history.\n[90016#3] Big five game - The African elephant (\"Loxodonta africana\") is a very large herbivore having thick, almost hairless skin, a long, flexible, prehensile trunk, upper incisors forming long curved tusks of ivory, and large, fan-shaped ears. The two distinct species of African elephant are: African forest elephant (\"Loxodonta cyclotis\") and the African bush elephant (\"Loxodonta africana\"). Elephants are difficult to hunt because, despite their large size, they are able to hide in tall grass and are more likely to charge than the other species.\n[20597989#7] African bush elephant - The African bush elephant is the largest and heaviest land animal on Earth, being up to tall at the shoulder and in weight (a male shot in 1974, near Mucusso, southern Angola). On average, males are about tall at the shoulder and in weight, while females are much smaller at about tall at the shoulder and in weight. Elephants attain their maximum stature when they complete the fusion of long-bone epiphyses, occurring in males around the age of 40 and females around the age of 25. Their large size means that they must consume around 50 gallons of water every day in order to stay hydrated.\n[326177#10] African forest elephant - African forest elephants travel in smaller groups than other elephant species. A typical group size consists of 2 to 8 individuals. The average family unit is 3 to 5 individuals, usually made up of female relatives. Most family groups are a mother and several of her offspring, or several groups of females and their offspring that interact with one another, especially at forest clearings. Female offspring are philopatric, male offspring disperse at maturity. Unlike African savanna elephants (\"Loxodonta africana\"), African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) do not usually interact with other family groups. Male African forest elephants tend to be solitary and only associate with other elephants during the mating season. Males have a dominance hierarchy based on size.\n[20597989#1] African bush elephant - The bush elephant is much larger in height and weight than the forest elephant, while the forest elephant has rounder ears and a trunk that tends to be more hairy. The adult bush elephant has no predators other than humans. While the most numerous of the three extant elephant species, its population continues to decline due to poaching for ivory and destruction of habitat. Elephants are social animals, traveling in herds of females and adolescents, while adult males usually live alone. The desert elephant or desert-adapted elephant is not a distinct species of elephant, but are African bush elephants that live in the Namib and Sahara deserts.\n[1416251#13] African elephant - African elephants are highly intelligent, and they have a very large and highly convoluted neocortex, a trait they share with humans, apes and some dolphin species. They are amongst the world's most intelligent species. With a mass of just over 5 kg (11 lb), elephant brains are larger than those of any other land animal, and although the largest whales have body masses twentyfold those of a typical elephant, whale brains are barely twice the mass of an elephant's brain. The elephant's brain is similar to that of humans in terms of structure and complexity. For example, the elephant's cortex has as many neurons as that of a human brain, suggesting convergent evolution.\n[1090259#33] Cleveland Metroparks Zoo - In 2011, the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo opened its newest exhibit, African Elephant Crossing. At a total cost of $25 million, the state of the art habitat quadrupled the elephants' living space, allowing the zoo to increase its number of African elephants from three, to a herd of eight to ten. The exhibit features two large ranges—the Savanna and the Mopani—spread out over several acres. The ranges include deep ponds so that the elephants can swim, as well as expanded sleeping quarters. Areas of the ranges are also heated to maximize the elephants' habitat during the winter months. Periodically throughout the day, the elephants are shepherded across the pathway between the ranges, allowing visitors an up-close view of the animals. In addition to expanding the number of African elephants, the African Elephant Crossing exhibit introduced meerkats, naked mole rats, an African rock python and several species of birds.\n[1416251#1] African elephant - One species of African elephant, the bush elephant, is the largest living terrestrial animal, while the forest elephant is the third-largest. Their thickset bodies rest on stocky legs, and they have concave backs. Their large ears enable heat loss. The upper lip and nose form a trunk. The trunk acts as a fifth limb, a sound amplifier, and an important method of touch. African elephants' trunks end in two opposing lips, whereas the Asian elephant trunk ends in a single lip. In \"L. africana\", males stand tall at the shoulder and weigh , while females stand tall and weigh ; \"L. cyclotis\" is smaller with male shoulder heights of up to . The largest recorded individual stood at the shoulder and weighed .

    "prompt": "Question: When was the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea formed?\n\nContexts: [199078#9] List of Presidents of South Korea - Three of the Governments proclaimed in 1919 continued to be active in the months after the March 1st Movement; the Governments proclaimed in Seoul, Shanghai and Vladivostok. After a period of negotiations, members of these three governments agreed to form the unified Provisional Government in Shanghai, with succession of the legitimacy of the Seoul Government and bringing the members of the Vladivostok legislature into the Shanghai legislature. The unified Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was established on 11 September 1919 with a new constitution.\n[199078#1] List of Presidents of South Korea - Prior to the establishment of the First Republic in 1948, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea established in Shanghai in September 1919 as the continuation of several governments proclaimed in the aftermath of March 1st Movement earlier that year coordinated Korean people's resistance against Japan during the Japanese occupation of Korea. The legitimacy of the Provisional Government has been recognised and succeeded by South Korea in the latter's original Constitution of 1948 and the current Constitution of 1988. Nine people have served twenty-four terms as Heads of State (with varying titles) of the Provisional Government between September 1919 and August 1948.\n[341418#57] Korea under Japanese rule - Objection to Japanese rule over Korea continued, and the 1 March Movement was a catalyst for the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea by Korean émigrés in Shanghai on 13 April 1919. The modern South Korean government considers this Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea the \"de jure\" representation of the Korean people throughout the period of Japanese rule.\n[253129#21] Succession of states - An important tenet of the modern state of Republic of Korea is that the Korean Empire's incorporation into the Empire of Japan from 1910 to 1945 constituted an illegal occupation. In 1919 when the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was formed it claimed continuity directly from their pre-1910 status. In 1948 when the modern Republic of Korea was formed it claimed that it was identical with Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea and that the Provisional Government succeeded the Korean Empire.\n[44505774#1] Jo So-ang - He participated in drawing up a draft of the proclamation of the independence of Korea in 1918 while he was studying in Japan, and after 1919, worked for the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea as the secretary of the provisional government and head of the Korean Independence Party. He also organized the society of policies on current affairs with Kim Gu and Yeo Unhyeong, contributing to establish the theories on diplomacy of the provisional government. In the political scene of liberated Korea, he was one of the right politicians, who stuck to the legitimacy of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. In 1948, he visited Pyongyang to attend the joint conference of leaders of parties and social groups in the entire nation with Kim Gu and Kim Gyusik, which was turned out to be a failure. He abandoned his direction for North-South Korea's cooperation, leading to one-sided establishment of Republic of Korea in favor.\n[199078#7] List of Presidents of South Korea - The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (대한민국 임시정부) was established in Shanghai on 11 April 1919 as a result of the first meeting of the Provisional Assembly from the previous night (10 April 1919). Syngman Rhee was elected as the Chancellor (국무총리). The Government was amalgamated with the Governments proclaimed in Seoul and Vladivostok on 11 September 1919 to form the unified Provisional Government.\n[2033707#1] Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea - On April 11, 1919, the provisional constitution was enacted, and the national sovereignty was called \"Republic of Korea\" and the political system was called \"Democratic Republic\". Introduced the presidential system and established three separate systems of legislative, administrative and judicial separation, the KPG inherited the territory of the former Korean Empire and stated that he favored the former imperial court. It actively supported and supported the independence movement under the provisional government, and received economic and military support from the Kuomintang of China, the Soviet Union and France.\n[48605#92] History of Korea - The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was established in Shanghai, China, in the aftermath of the March 1 Movement, which coordinated the Liberation effort and resistance against Japanese control. Some of the achievements of the Provisional Government include the Battle of Chingshanli of 1920 and the ambush of Japanese Military Leadership in China in 1932. The Provisional Government is considered to be the \"de jure\" government of the Korean people between 1919 and 1948. Its legitimacy is enshrined in the preamble to the constitution of the Republic of Korea.\n[44505774#2] Jo So-ang - He ran for a representative of the national assembly and was elected in 1950. In the same year when the Korean war broke out, he was abducted and taken to North Korea.\nJo So-ang served roles in the national government, the political structure of the Provisional Government, and in public relations. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was established on April 13, 1919, following the March 1st movement. The interim government resisted Japan’s colonial rule of Korea and supported the Korean independence movement. In the midst of dividing political alliances, Jo So-ang remained loyal to the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea and was elected as their secretary and diplomatic correspondent. Making him in charge of the interim government’s remittances, propaganda, and public relations work. In May 1919, Jo traveled to Europe in order to attend the International Socialist Conference to appeal international support and recognition for South Korea's independence movement. In March 1921, after attending the Communist Party Congress in Moscow, Russia, he returned to Beijing with critical views on communism. Jo would incorporate his views and experience with communism when writing his political theories and teachings.\n[2198844#78] Allies of World War II - The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was established on April 13, 1919. During the time when the Provisional Government was created, Korea was under Japanese rule. The Provisional Government had governmental tasks and created important organizations for their independence movement, such as the Korean Liberation Army (KLA) on September 17, 1940. The Provisional Government also declared war against the Empire of Japan on December 10, 1941. The Provisional Government is also the first democratic government of Korea.\n[2033707#2] Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea - After the Surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945, figures such as Kim Gu returned. On August 15, 1948, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was dissolved. Rhee, who was the first president of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, became the first President of the Republic of Korea in 1948. The Constitution of South Korea, which was amended in 1987, stated that the Korean people inherited the rule of the KPG.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Is John Part still alive?\n\nContexts: [20606247#30] Red John - By the episode \"Blinking Red Light\", it is now widely believed that Red John is dead, with Jane and Lisbon the only ones aware he is still alive. One of the people believing Red John to be dead is James Panzer, a blogger pretending to devote his life to find a serial killer known as \"the San Joaquin Killer\" (abbreviated SJK, who has killed at least five young women). In reality, Panzer is the killer. Jane suspects Panzer but initially lacks the proof to expose him. When he and Panzer both appear on Karen Cross's television talk show discussing the SJK case, Jane recognizes Panzer has to be stopped and goads Panzer into comparing Red John unfavorably to SJK. Panzer rises to the bait, making bold statements that the SJK killings were the work of a genius and Red John by comparison is a \"\"common sociopath, lazy, sloppy, delusional\"\" and already forgotten since Jane killed him. Panzer then makes the same mistake made by Jane and Kristina Frye: belittling Red John in a public forum. A couple of hours after the television appearance, Panzer is found murdered, with Red John's smiley face painted in blood on one of the walls near his body. Panzer's murder proves Jane's theory that Red John is still alive. This makes Panzer Red John's ninth male victim.\n[946164#7] The Green Mile (film) - Elaine realizes that, since he had a grown son in 1935, Paul must be much older than he looks. Paul reveals that he is, in fact, 108 years of age; he was 44 when John walked the Green Mile. Not only is he still alive, but so is Del's mouse, Mr. Jingles. Paul continues to explain that although John never intended for it to happen, his curing of Paul has given him an extraordinary lifespan, causing him to outlive his family and friends, which he perceives is a punishment from God for executing John, and will also outlive Elaine. Paul later attends her funeral and muses that if John's power could make a normally short-lived mouse live for six decades as Mr. Jingles has, how much longer does he himself have left.\n[24258441#27] Peter Evans (restaurateur) - He kept potentially expensive company round the card table. His opponents included John Bingham (later Lord Lucan), before his fall the most formidable stud poker player in London. Evans is frequently asked whether or not he believes that Lucan murdered Sandra Rivett in November 1974. \"John was a killer at the poker table, a pussycat away from it. Certainly not!\" And is Lucan still alive? \"His family is long-lived. John is probably still with us, possibly living right here in the UK!\" In Evans's opinion, Lucan should now come forward \"to face the music\" and prove his innocence.\n[7424526#4] Out of Time (Torchwood) - John finds that his son is still alive but suffers from Alzheimer's disease and is in a nursing home, with no children to help look after him. Assisted by Jack Harkness, John visits his son, who barely remembers John's presence. John becomes very remorseful at missing his son's life and being unable to adapt to modern times.\n[38639945#9] Mindscape (film) - Elsewhere, Anna arranges to have John sent a single red rose, along with a picture of her holding a recent newspaper to show that she is still alive. John, now released from prison, drives to the beach house to find a new family has bought it and are sitting happily together on the front porch. John is then able to move on with his life and find peace with Judith.\n[7892039#4] Carter McKay - Carter was still alive in 2014. His grandson Hunter, Tommy's son, is a video game millionaire; he has known John Ross Ewing since childhood, and still holds a grudge against the Ewings. He makes a secret deal with Nicolas Treviño to take control of Ewing Global, laughing at John Ross that Carter had tricked J.R. the same way. Meanwhile, Bobby seeks out Tracey (now Melinda Clarke) to get her help in negotiating a resolution with her nephew. But Hunter is unaware that Nicolas works for a Mexican drug cartel, and when the deal is done, they murder Hunter and make it look like suicide.\n[26730077#6] The Interrupted Journey - Fearing he could be hanged for a crime he did not commit, John visits the Wildings' house in London, suspecting that Mr Wilding is still alive. However, Wilding's mother tells him that she identified her son's body. John then travels down to the hotel in Plymouth where he had planned to stay with Susan. There, he finds Wilding, who tells him that he was on the train and murdered his wife for being unfaithful, and then planted his identifying papers on one of the dead. The two men fight and Wilding shoots John in the head.\n[24390121#3] Still Alive - The song \"Still Alive\" was written by Jonathan Coulton and performed by Ellen McLain for the \"Portal\" video game. McLain also provides the voice for GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence for the fictional Aperture Science Enrichment Center and the game's antagonist. \"Still Alive\" is sung from the perspective of GLaDOS and used as the song that runs over the game's credits. By the end of the game, Chell, the game's protagonist who has been misled and placed in life-threatening situations within the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, the setting of the game, by GLaDOS, will have finally encountered and defeated GLaDOS. However, the song and portions of post-credit scenes suggests that GLaDOS is still functional, and despite having been apparently destroyed by Chell, is \"not even angry\" at that prospect, having considered the monitoring of Chell's performance through the test chambers as a \"huge success\", regardless of the destruction caused by Chell and the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device being released into the outside world, for those that are \"still alive\". The Combine invasion of Earth from the \"Half-Life\" series was also hinted in the song by GLaDOS (\"Go ahead and leave me, I think I'd prefer to stay inside. Maybe you'll find someone else to help you. Maybe Black Mesa. That was a joke. Ha Ha. Fat Chance.\"). The song itself is also present as a samba instrumental version through in-game radios at certain points within the game.\n[5440222#7] Beau Geste (1926 film) - After each Legionnaire is killed, Lejaune props up his body and makes it appear he is still alive. Finally, only Lejaune, Beau and John remain. Then Beau is seemingly killed. When John sees Lejaune searching Beau's body, he grabs his bayonet, but Lejaune draws his pistol and sentences him to death. Beau, barely alive, grabs Lejaune's leg, enabling John to stab him. Before dying, Beau tells John to desert and deliver a letter to their aunt. When John spots the relief force, he fires a single shot, then leaves.\n[11156938#8] Patrick Hepburn of Waughton - Sir Patrick was, according to a charter dated 24 June 1646, still alive then, but is thought to have died before 9 November 1649, when his son John was Retoured his heir. That was followed on the same day by a Precept from Chancery for infefting John Hepburne, now of Wauchtoun, as heir to his father, Sir Patrick Hepburne of Wauchtoun, Knt. in the lands and baronies of Wauchtoun and The Bass, and other lands in the sheriffdoms of Edinburgh and Berwick.\n[1716726#0] John Part - John Part (born June 29, 1966) is a Canadian professional darts player and commentator, nicknamed Darth Maple. Part is a three-times World Champion, having won the 1994 BDO World Darts Championship, and the PDC World Championship in 2003 and 2008. He is statistically North America's greatest darts player to date. He has the distinction of being the first non-UK player to win the World Championship, and the only non-European to date to win the PDC World Darts Championship. His first Championship was the second time a non-seeded player won the BDO World Darts Championship, and one of the few times where a player only lost one set in the entire tournament. His nine year gap between his first and second World Championships is tied with Ted Hankey for the longest gap between World Championships, and his third triumph in 2008 saw him become the first player in history to win a world title in three different venues, and the first to win at the Alexandra Palace. His 2008 win saw him join Phil Taylor, Eric Bristow, Raymond van Barneveld and John Lowe as the only players with three or more World Championships, and become only the second player (after Taylor) to win multiple PDC titles. His eleven televised PDC finals is tied with Dennis Priestley for the eighth most all time, and his £874,151 in prize money to date is the sixteenth highest amount in PDC history.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What government system do the Dutch have?\n\nContexts: [1191676#39] Geert Wilders - Wilders strongly opposes the Dutch political system in general. He believes that there is a ruling elite of parliamentarians who only care about their own personal careers and disregard the will of the people. He also blames the Dutch system of multiparty coalition governments for a lack of clear and effective policies. In his view, Dutch society advocates rule by consensus and cultural relativism, while he believes that this should change so as \"not [to] tolerate the intolerant\".\n[59761#0] Politics of the Netherlands - The politics of the Netherlands take place within the framework of a parliamentary representative democracy, a constitutional monarchy and a decentralised unitary state. The Netherlands is described as a consociational state. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by a common striving for broad consensus on important issues, within both of the political community and society as a whole.\n[13849806#11] History of Dutch nationality - Even though urban governments showed rare signs of democracy they were primarily an oligarchic system marked by an exclusive hierarchy. Class divisions, however were not as deep as in other European states, and the rights that the common class possessed did not differ much from what the intellectuals could practice. There was a cultural harmony and it prevented the formation of two completely divided classes and allowed for a social participation of all. Similarly, the basis of education was the same for all, and this allowed for a social bond. The difference in rights that the upper and lower classes possessed was reduced to the amount of money available to the individual. If one was wealthy, he could afford higher-level education. However, this alone did not earn him any political privileges or extensive political rights but only the ability to earn more wealth. \nThe whole population of the Dutch Republic did not have the choice of voting for the representative of the Country inasmuch as there was not a choice between a democracy and an aristocracy but rather between an aristocracy and a monarchy. The stadtholder would be a member of the House of Orange-Nassau.\n[70124#19] Constitution of the Netherlands - Some of the most basic fundamental laws in the Dutch constitutional system are not explicitly expressed in the written Constitution. These include the rule that the Dutch monarch cannot dissolve the House of Representatives more than once because of a conflict over a single political issue and that the Senate shall never block legislation for mere party politics, so that coalition governments (all Dutch governments since the 19th century) do not need a majority in the Senate.\n[70124#42] Constitution of the Netherlands - The Legislative is formed by Government (i.e. King and ministers) and the States General in cooperation (Article 81), although the term \"legislative\" is not actually used: the article simply states that government and the States General together make laws. This means that the Dutch concept of \"formal law\" cannot simply be equated to \"Act of Parliament\", as government and parliament act in unison in creating laws. In the Dutch constitutional system there is no decisive referendum, although sometimes consultative referenda are held, like the one in 2005 in which the people advised to reject the European Constitution; the Dutch people is thus not a direct lawgiver.\n[70124#47] Constitution of the Netherlands - According to present doctrine, that of \"treaty monism\", treaties are in the Dutch legal system in principle self-executing; no special transformation is needed by implementing special law, as in countries with a \"dualistic\" system (such as the United Kingdom). However, when the present articles covering this subject were last revisioned, in 1953, doctrine was divided and some defended a more dualistic position, that of \"limited monism\". They demanded the constitution to be neutral on this issue and this has led to some infelicitous results. Government originally intended that Article 93, stating that treaties of a generally binding nature would only have such binding force after they had been published, to be simply a safeguard, protecting the citizen against duties imposed on him by such treaty. However, the \"limited monists\" held that only such published treaties are self-executing and that thus Article 93 is the basis for all treaty monism; to appease them government stated that the article should in any case be read as covering also the treaties conferring rights on the citizen and imposing duties upon government. The unintended result was that government might thus in principle withhold rights to the citizen by not publishing the treaty. Article 94 determines that legal prescripts are inapplicable if they conflict with treaties of a generally binding nature. This means that laws can be tested against treaty norms and obligations. Dutch courts have however been very reluctant to do so, limiting this to cases where government has been left no freedom of policy at all by the treaty, or to severe formal and procedural defects. The case law is very complex and contradictory, complicated by the fact that the phrase \"generally binding nature\" is assumed to have exactly the same meaning in both articles. Article 95 states that law regulates the publication of treaties or (binding) decisions of international organisations; delegation is allowed.\n[21148#115] Netherlands - While Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If you don't take out insurance, you risk a fine. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health – it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.\n[18181188#0] Dualism (politics) - In Dutch politics the term dualism is used to refer to the separation of powers between the cabinet and parliament. In this respect, the way the Dutch cabinets function is somewhat semi-presidential in its system of government, not parliamentary. Unlike the presidential system, the legislative branch consists of the cabinet together with the parliament and cabinets are formed on basis of a majority in parliament. Unlike the Westminster parliamentary system, cabinet ministers cannot be members of parliament. An important political issue is whether ministers and leaders of governing parliamentary parties should prepare important political decisions. According to the dualistic position, members of parliament of governing parties should function independently of their cabinet. The term monism is used to refer to a stance that important decisions should be prepared by the members of the governing coalition in order to promote political stability.\n[18159080#8] Provincial politics in the Netherlands - Dutch provinces do not have many competencies. As the level of government between national government and the municipal government, it is responsible for those affairs for which the national government is too large and the municipalities too small. In most competencies the provinces have an executive function, executing policy which is made at the national level. The provincial competencies, often shared with national and municipal government include:\n[52786#70] Local government - Water boards (\"waterschap\" and \"hoogheemraadschap\", pl. \"waterschappen\" and \"hoogheemraadschappen\") are among the oldest government authorities in the Netherlands. They literally form the foundation of the whole Dutch system of local government; from time immemorial they have shouldered the responsibility for water management for the residents of their area. In polders this mainly involves regulating the water level. It has always been in the common interest to keep water out and polder residents have always had to work together. That is what led to the creation of water boards. The structure of the water boards varies, but they all have a general administrative body and an executive board (\"college van dijkgraaf en heemraden\") consisting of a chairperson (\"dijkgraaf\") and other members (\"(hoog)heemraad\", pl. \"(hoog)heemraden\"). The chairperson also presides the general administrative body. This body consists of people representing the various categories of stakeholders: landholders, leaseholders, owners of buildings, companies and, since recently, all the residents as well. Importance and financial contribution decide how many representatives each category may delegate. Certain stakeholders (e.g. environmental organisations) may be given the power to appoint members. The general administrative body elects the executive board from among its members. The government appoints the chairperson for a period of six years. The general administrative body is elected for a period of four years. In the past the administrative body was elected as individuals but from 2009 they will be elected as party representatives. Unlike municipal council elections, voters do not usually have to go to a polling station but can vote by mail.\n[19352809#12] Municipal politics in the Netherlands - Dutch municipalities do not have a delineated set of competences. In most competences the municipalities have an executive function, executing policy which is made at the national or provincial level. Legally municipalities have an \"open household\" which means that it can take on any competence it wishes as long as it does not violate national policy or break constitutional bounds. The municipality competences, often shared with national and municipal government include:\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When was Rockwood Hall built?\n\nContexts: [53870086#2] Rockwood Road Historic District - The historic district extends along Rockwood Road from Boardman Street southeasterly, ending just before the railroad tracks. Although the latter were important to the community's growth, and there is still a commuter rail stop there, it no longer has a historic station house. Most of the buildings in the district are residences built between about 1850 and 1900, although there are examples of older and newer buildings. The oldest buildings in the district are probably Mann House at 16 Rockwood Road (c. 1806), and the Darius Ware House at 29 Rockwood Road, which dates to about 1814. The only originally non-residential building in the district is the Norfolk Grange Hall, which was built as a Baptist church in 1863, and was the first church to be built away from the historic Town Hill area.\n[38801511#1] Rockwood Summit High School - In early 1992, Rockwood School District determined the necessity of constructing two new high schools to serve an expanding population. After voting to build the schools in March 1992, the Rockwood Board of Education unanimously voted to name the new southeast high school as Rockwood Summit High School. In May 1992, the board named Tom Hensley as the first principal of the school, and construction began that summer according to designs by the William B. Ittner architectural firm. Rock blasting was required to construct the building, which increased the cost by $207,000. The original estimate for the building was $17 million; the total cost of the building upon completion was $22.7 million, although the school was built with a combined cafeteria and theater to save $2.5 million. Among the $22.7 million cost of the building, costs for the pool facilities were $400,000, roofing and sheet metal were $780,000, masonry was $995,000, and data and voice networks were $200,000. When built, Summit featured a two-story commons and atrium, 77 classrooms, several computer labs, and art, music and theater facilities. The school opened on September 7, 1993, on the same day as Marquette High School, which was the first time that a school district in the St. Louis area had opened two new high schools on the same day. It opened with 635 9th and 10th grade students.\n[42947572#37] Rockwood Hall - The house's architecture inspired the design of the Sacred Heart Academy in Cincinnati, Ohio, which was built from 1864 to 1867 by Thomas Sargent as a private home for William C. Neff. The Cincinnati building is described as a \"copy reversed left-to-right\" of Rockwood Hall. The likely intermediate sources for Sargent were images published in \"Villas on the Hudson\", by A. A. Turner.\n[42947572#10] Rockwood Hall - Rockefeller's heirs put the property up for sale, however no individual buyer could be found. At this point, the mansion was closed, its furnishings were removed, and about 20 caretakers were tending to the property. The first breakup of his property was a sale to Frank Vanderlip. In 1924, Vanderlip purchased 57 acres of Rockwood Hall's riverfront property to add to his estate, Beechwood. The bulk of the estate was purchased that same year by a group of investors, who formed Rockwood Hall, Inc. Their company purchased the property (with 210 acres west of Route 9 and 600 acres east) for around $1 million. The group converted the estate into a country club with a golf course, a swimming pool, and other facilities. The company formed Rockwood Hall Country Club and took out a mortgage with the Equitable Trust Company of New York, which was acquired by Chase Bank in 1930. Its 18-hole golf course was designed by Emmet & Tull in 1929. Rockwood Hall Country Club hired noted Australian golfer Joe Kirkwood Sr. to be the club's first golf professional.\n[42947572#12] Rockwood Hall - The Rockwood Hall club was building up debts, especially during the Great Depression, which began in 1929. The club was ultimately not financially successful, and declared bankruptcy in 1936. During the summer of 1937, Rockwood Hall Country Club leased the house and grounds to the Washington Irving Country Club and the coachhouse and stable to the Washington Irving Theater during Rockwood's foreclosure suit. The coachhouse and stable were remodeled and began showing summer productions beginning in 1938 and ending by 1940.\n[42947572#3] Rockwood Hall - Importer and merchant Edwin Bartlett obtained the property around 1848, demolished the farmhouse, and built Rockwood, an English Gothic castle of locally-quarried stone. Bartlett hired Gervase Wheeler to design the house, which was built in 1849.\nBartlett sold the house to his business partner William Henry Aspinwall in 1860; Aspinwall made it his summer home and improved the property and house, and purchased enough land to make his estate . Aspinwall would often travel from New York City to the property via his yacht \"Firefly\", which he could moor to his dock at Rockwood Hall.\n[42947572#9] Rockwood Hall - Rockefeller intended the house to be his summer retreat, yet in his later years it became his year-round home. In 1922, Rockefeller died within Rockwood Hall, leaving the property empty. His funeral took place in Rockwood Hall, with a service by the rector of Saint Mary's Episcopal Church, which Rockefeller regularly attended. The gates of the estate were closed and guarded by policemen during the affair.\n[42947572#11] Rockwood Hall - In 1927, Rockefeller's nephew John D. Rockefeller Jr. purchased 450 acres across Route 9 from Rockwood. In the following year, the Rockwood Hall club sold 166.5 acres of its own land east of Route 9 to John Jr., in order to settle or reduce two of its mortgages. By 1928, the club was profitable enough to plan to expand its property; the club planned for a second golf course on an adjacent property, as well as adjustments to most of its existing course and construction of four tennis courts and an outdoor pool. In the same year, Frederic N. Gilbert was removed as a member of the country club for allegedly trying to obtain control of it. Frank Harris Hitchcock was President of the club at the time, and had been the club's first president. Gilbert took legal action against the club.\n[42947572#14] Rockwood Hall - Rockefeller Jr. deeded Rockwood Hall to his son Laurence Rockefeller on April 8, 1946. Later that year, the property was proposed for the location of the United Nations headquarters. It was one of a few proposals for the site, and was given by Laurence and Nelson Rockefeller for free. Officials of Westchester County had previously proposed the same site. Their father, John Jr., was cautious about the proposal, believing that the site's occupancy would prompt the UN's expansion onto other Rockefeller properties nearby in Pocantico Hills, and possibly even Kykuit, the family's seat. Laurence and Nelson, along with their brothers David and John, were all willing to give up their estates to make the site location possible. John Jr. expressed that the nature of the countryside in Westchester would be irrevocably changed. He instructed Nelson to inquire further about another proposed site near White Plains, New York, and to see about additional available land near Rockwood. Another reason given for John Jr.'s disapproval of the site was its distance from airports and other transportation available in New York City.\nLaurance sold 80 acres of the property to IBM in 1970; New York Life later operated out of the site. Laurance had planned to donate Rockwood Hall to New York State, and made the IBM sale to offset the loss of tax revenue to the town of Mount Pleasant. During Laurence's ownership of the remaining land, he made the space available to the public for hiking, fishing, and other recreation.\n[42947572#38] Rockwood Hall - In 2014 and 2015, the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, a nearby non-profit farm, tended sheep and goats at Rockwood Hall. The effort was described as an experiment in land management to improve landscape health and ecosystem function, as well as possibly to increase access to land for beginning farmers by allowing them access to parks and other public lands. During the project, a shepherd would rotate the flock every few days through a series of paddocks, coaxing the animals to graze invasive plants like akebia and porcelain berry. The project gave the center additional land and forage for sheep, and helped control invasive plants and improve soil health. Local supporters of the project included New York Life, which supplied water, and the nearby retirement community Kendal on Hudson. From July to November 2014, the farm tended 50 sheep and 7 goats in the pastures of Rockwood Hall. In 2015, 10 Boer goats, 30 Tunis sheep, and 50 Finn Dorset sheep were moved to Rockwood Hall to graze.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Why do lions kill their own cubs?\n\nContexts: [47373041#28] Killing of Cecil the lion - When one or more new male lions oust or replace a previous male(s) associated with a pride, they often kill any existing young cubs, a form of infanticide. Initially, both the University of Oxford study and Johnny Rodrigues, head of the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, indicated that they believed Cecil's six cubs could be killed by the new dominant male in the pride. In a later interview, however, Rodrigues said Jericho had assumed control of the pride but had not killed Cecil's cubs, and that he was also keeping the cubs safe from any rivals.\n[718143#35] Lahore Zoo - Lahore Zoo received a pair of Bengal tigers from Belgium in 1992 to start their captive breeding program. In 1997, six Bengal tigers died from \"Trypanosomiasis\" at the zoo, and in 2006, four more became victims. In July 2007, two female Bengal tigers, one of which had given the zoo 19 cubs, died from same disease. In early May 2009, a 3-year-old female Bengal tiger died after a cesarean section to take out her dead babies. In April 2009, a Bengal tiger gave birth to four In July 2009, a lion gave birth to two cubs but killed them by eating their heads. Director, Zafar Shah, said that the lion had been killing her cubs for the last three years and is a victim of \"cannibalism\" - a mental disease found in 5-6% of lions worldwide. At Lahore Zoo, there have been many births of Bengal tiger cubs who are deformed and do not survive long. In late 2010, the officials showed concern for the issue of inbreeding that might be the reason behind these deaths.\n[36896#37] Lion - When first introduced to the rest of the pride, lion cubs lack confidence when confronted with adults other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of the cubs varies – sometimes a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.\nWeaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest. When one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. Females often fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the male. Cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. Up to 80% of lion cubs will die before the age of two.\n[253536#6] Joy Adamson - In January 1961, Elsa died from disease resulting from a tick bite. Her three young cubs became a nuisance, killing the livestock of local farmers. The Adamsons, who feared the farmers might kill the cubs, were able to eventually capture them and transport them to neighboring Tanganyika Territory, where they were promised a home at Serengeti National Park. In the concluding part of \"Forever Free\" the Adamsons lost track of the cubs in their new home. After describing a fruitless search, Joy Adamson contemplated a pair of lions: \"My heart was with them wherever they were. But it was also with these two lions here in front of us; and as I watched this beautiful pair, I realized how all the characteristics of our cubs were inherent in them. Indeed, in every lion I saw during our searches I recognized the intrinsic nature of Elsa, Jespah, Gopa and Little Elsa, the spirit of all the magnificent lions in Africa\".\n[3407787#8] Cinderella effect - Daly and Wilson point out that infanticide is an extreme form of biasing parental investment that is widely practiced in the animal world. For example, when an immigrant male lion enters a pride, it is not uncommon for him to kill the cubs fathered by other males. Since the pride can only provide support for a limited number of cubs to survive to adulthood, the killing of the cubs in competition with the new male's potential offspring increases the chances of his progeny surviving to maturity. In addition, the act of infanticide speeds the return to sexual receptivity in the females, allowing for the male to father his own offspring in a timelier manner. These observations indicate that in the animal world, males employ certain measures in order to ensure that parental investment is geared specifically toward their own offspring.\n[551581#1] Born Free - When George Adamson is forced to kill a lion, after the lion kills a native villager, and then George kills a lioness out of self-defence, he brings home the three orphaned cubs she had been trying to protect. The Adamsons tend to the three orphaned lion cubs to young lionhood, and, when the time comes, the two largest are sent to the Rotterdam Zoo, while Elsa the Lioness (the smallest of the litter) remains with Joy. When Elsa is held responsible for stampeding a herd of elephants through a village, John Kendall, Adamson's boss, gives the couple three months to either rehabilitate Elsa to the wild, or send her to a zoo. Joy opposes sending Elsa to a zoo, and spends much time attempting to reintroduce Elsa to the life of a wild lion in a distant reserve. At last, she succeeds, and with mixed feelings and a breaking heart, she returns her friend to the wild. The Adamsons then depart for their home in England; a year later they return to Kenya for a week, hoping to find Elsa. They do, and happily discover she hasn't forgotten them and is the mother of three cubs. The Adamsons made an agreement not to handle the cubs, in contrast to the way they did with Elsa.The film's credits list lions and lionesses Boy, Girl, Henrietta, Mara, Ugas, and \"the Cubs\".\n[27919#6] Sociobiology - For example, newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire. This behavior is adaptive because killing the cubs eliminates competition for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster, thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population. Sociobiologists would view this instinctual cub-killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, whereas non-killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in reproducing.\n[1635424#29] Asiatic lion - Asiatic lions mate foremost between September and January. Mating lasts three to six days. During these days, they usually do not hunt, but only drink water. Gestation lasts about 110 days. Litters comprise one to four cubs.\nDominant males mate more frequently than their coalition partners. During a study carried out between December 2012 and December 2016, three females were observed switching mating partners in favour of the dominant male.\nThe average interval between births is 24 months, unless cubs die due to infanticide by adult males or because of diseases and injuries. Cubs become independent at the age of about two years. Subadult males leave their natal pride latest at the age of three years and become nomads until they establish their own territory.\n[6173994#27] Cannibalism - Infanticide is the killing of a non-adult animal by an adult of the same species. Infanticide is often, but not always, accompanied by cannibalism. It is often displayed in lions; a male lion encroaching on the territory of a rival pride will often kill any existing cubs fathered by other males; this brings the lionesses into heat more quickly, enabling the invading lion to sire his own young. This is a good example of cannibalistic behavior in a genetic context.\n[42835364#27] Cowardly Lion - The Cowardly Lion is a minor character in author Gregory Maguire's 1995 revisionist novel \"\" and its 2003 Broadway musical adaptation. In both works, he is first seen as a Lion Cub (lion with human attributes) who has been torn from his mother and used as an experiment (in the book by Doctor Dillamond's replacement, Doctor Nikidik, and in the musical an agent of the Wizard) on the nature of Animals. Elphaba (the future Wicked Witch of the West) saves the Lion Cub that in the end of both adaptations attempts to kill her. He also appears in Maguire's 2005 sequel \"Son of a Witch\", also in a minor role. The Cowardly Lion is the central character in the third book of the series, \"A Lion Among Men\", where he is given the name of Brrr, which was the name given to him in \"Wicked\". Doctor Nikidik mentions that he intended to give the Lion Cub the name of Prrr, but since \"it shivers more than it purrs,\" he names it Brrr.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: How long does it take for a live Christmas tree to reach maturity?\n\nContexts: [464301#42] Pinus strobus - Smaller specimens are popular as live Christmas trees. Eastern white pines are noted for holding their needles well, even long after being harvested. They also are well suited for people with allergies, as they give little to no aroma. A standard tree takes approximately 6 to 8 years to grow in ideal conditions. Sheared varieties are usually desired because of their stereotypical Christmas tree conical shape, as naturally grown ones can become too thick for larger ornaments, or grow bushy in texture. The branches of the eastern white pine are also widely used in making holiday wreaths and garland because of their soft, feathery needles.\n[5019316#11] Pallid sturgeon - Pallid sturgeon have a long lifespan, living in excess of 50 and perhaps as long as 100 years. They lack bones and scales, which makes it more difficult to establish their age and determine exactly how long they live. As is true for many long-lived species, pallid sturgeon reach reproductive maturity relatively late. Males reach sexual maturity between the ages of 5 and 7 years, while females are believed to become capable of reproduction when they are at least 15 years old. One study of nine females indicated that they begin egg development between the ages of 9 and 12 years, but do not reach reproductive maturity until they are 15 years old. Reproduction does not take place every year; the average interval between spawnings is three years, although other studies suggest an interval as long as 10 years. Spawning usually takes place May to July.\n[7770#57] Christmas tree - The life cycle of a Christmas tree from the seed to a tree takes, depending on species and treatment in cultivation, between 8 and 12 years. First, the seed is extracted from cones harvested from older trees. These seeds are then usually grown in nurseries and then sold to Christmas tree farms at an age of 3–4 years. The remaining development of the tree greatly depends on the climate, soil quality, as well as the cultivation and how the trees are tended by the Christmas tree farmer.\n[1392499#5] Brachypelma - Compared to related genera, \"Brachypelma\" species are long-lived. The maximum life-span recorded in two Berlin zoos was 12 years for \"Brachypelma annitha\" (now a synonym of \"B. smithi\"). In the wild, females take around 9–10 years to reach maturity, but can then live for another 10 years. Males can take 7–8 years to reach maturity, afterwards usually dying within a year, probably because when mature they actively seek mates and rarely feed while doing so, whereas females remain around their burrows.\nStudies on Mexican species in the wild showed that pre-adult and adult spiders molt towards the end of the dry season, which lasts from June to November. After their last molt, adult males search for females, the west coast species travelling in the daytime, particularly in the morning and evening, and the east coast species travelling at night. Females produce an egg sac before they molt. The eggs hatch a few weeks before the rainy season begins. The spiderlings molt every two weeks for the first few months, then less frequently as they mature. A full-grown \"Brachypelma\" may molt as infrequently as once a year.\n[13105000#6] Christmas tree production - There are more than 20,000 North American Christmas tree growers, 95 percent of the trees they produce are sold or shipped directly from the farms. On each of the planted in Christmas trees annually there are usually about 2,000 trees, the number of trees that survive to harvest varies from 750–1,500 depending upon location. Christmas trees take an average of 6 to 10 years (from transplant) to mature for harvest and each year 73 million new Christmas trees are planted.\n[4428062#16] Tree shaping - With this method the time frame is longer than the other methods. A chair design might take 8 to 10 years to reach maturity Some of Axel Erlandson trees's took as long as 40 years to assume their finished shapes.\n[11058904#1] Euglandina rosea - The rosy wolfsnail lives for approximately 24 months. The snail takes 30–40 days to hatch and are then considered young (before they reach sexual maturity). Sexual maturity begins between 4–16 months after hatching. After reaching maturity they are considered an adult for the rest of their lives. The snail is relatively fast moving at about 8 mm/s. The snail has a light grey, or brown body, with its lower tentacles being long and almost touching the ground. The shell has usual dimensions of 76mm tall and 27.5 mm in diameter. The shape of the shell tapers to a point at both ends (fusiform) with a narrow oval to crescent shaped opening and a shortened axis of the spiral shell near the opening (truncated columella). The shell has a brownish pink color. The fully-grown adult snail ranges in size from 7–10 cm in length.\n[13105000#19] Christmas tree production - One appeal of Christmas tree farms to growers is that it can be a profitable way to use low quality farmland, though this trend is changing within the industry. Christmas tree farms can turn a profit in as little as six years, and though some overhead in equipment and labor does exist Christmas tree production requires only small amounts of up-front capital. Each tree can cost land owners $5–10 from the time it's planted as a seedling until it is harvested as a mature Christmas tree; that cost includes land costs, and costs accumulated through the growing process. In the early 21st century, Christmas tree farmers typically got annual returns of between $600–1,000 per acre of trees planted.\n[2190689#15] Fraser fir - The combination of form, needle retention, dark blue-green color, pleasant scent and excellent shipping characteristics has led to Fraser fir being a most popular Christmas tree species. Growing and harvesting this species for Christmas trees and boughs is a multimillion-dollar business in the southern Appalachians. North Carolina produces the majority of Fraser fir Christmas trees. It requires from 7 to 10 years in the field to produce a high tree. In 2005, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation making the Fraser fir the official Christmas tree of North Carolina.\n[13105009#13] Christmas tree cultivation - In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, a major Christmas tree growing region, Douglas-fir has always been the primary species grown. A full one-half of all trees produced in the Pacific Northwest are Douglas-fir. Douglas-firs typically take five to seven years before they are mature enough to sell as Christmas trees. Also common in the region are noble fir, a tree which commands a higher price than Douglas-fir, and grand fir, which accounts for about 10 percent of the annual harvest in the Northwest. Other species collectively account for only 3–5 percent of the total Northwest harvest.\n[18581082#33] Tarantula - Tarantulas may live for years; most species take two to five years to reach adulthood, but some species may take up to 10 years to reach full maturity. Upon reaching adulthood, males typically have but a 1.0- to 1.5-year period left to live and immediately go in search of a female with which to mate. Male tarantulas rarely molt again once they reach adulthood, but they may attempt to do so, usually becoming stuck during the molt due to their sexual organs and dying in the process.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What years did Count Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld live?\n\nContexts: [2987730#55] Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld - In January 1722, Frederick I summoned Rehnskiöld to Kungsör. Rehnskiöld fell ill during the journey and was taken to Läggesta Inn outside of Mariefred. Having high fever and spitting blood, his declining health indicated that he was suffering from his old shrapnel injury from Veprik. He died on 29 January the same year, and with his death, both the noble and the count's branch of the Rehnskiöld family was extinguished. The funeral took place on 15 March at Storkyrkan in Stockholm. The officiant was Chaplain Jöran Nordberg, who had followed Rehnskiöld and the army from 1703 to 1715. Rehnskiöld's widow, Elisabeth, married Imperial Count Erasmus Ernst Fredrik von Küssow in 1724, and died on 23 November 1726.\n[2987730#36] Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld - Throughout the campaign, Rehnskiöld held a fierce rivalry with the Marshal of the Realm, Count Carl Piper, who had accompanied Charles XII as chief of the perambulating chancellery since 1700. The tense relationship between Rehnskiöld and Piper dated back to the Swedish Army's march on Saxony. Both men desired the King's favor: as the senior civilian army official Piper sought to persuade the King not to make reckless actions, whilst Rehnskiöld, as second-in-command of the army supported the King's offensive plans. The antagonism between the two, in combination with their fiery temperament and pride in their own abilities, made them unable to reason with each other without an intermediary, a role usually filled by Quartermaster general Axel Gyllenkrok. Their relationship would eventually cause discord and division within the Swedish headquarters, as well as hopelessness and anxiety within the army.\n[2987730#3] Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld - After the battle, Rehnskiöld became a prisoner of war in Russia and spent the years in captivity together with Count Carl Piper by running a management office in Moscow to assist the other Swedish prisoners of war. Rehnskiöld was exchanged in 1718 and arrived at the siege of Fredriksten just before Charles XII was shot to death. Rehnskiöld later served as commander in western Sweden and, suffering from an old shrapnel injury, died in 1722.\n[2987730#0] Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld - Count Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld (6 August 1651 – 29 January 1722) was a Swedish Field Marshal (\"Fältmarskalk\") and Royal Councilor. He was King Charles XII's mentor and chief military advisor, and served as deputy commander-in-chief of the Carolean Army, an army he assisted both in its education and development.\n[2987730#32] Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld - The victory at Fraustadt had a crippling effect in Denmark, Russia and Saxony, and caused shock waves around Europe. In France, the victory was celebrated, and Prussian policy immediately became friendlier to the Swedes. In June the same year, Rehnskiöld was made Count (in 1719, the count’s branch of the Rehnskiöld family was introduced at the House of Nobility under number 48). With the main Saxon army defeated, the Swedish Army had the opportunity to move into Saxony and force Augustus II out of the war. In August, Charles XII reunited with Rehnskiöld’s army. The joint army moved through Imperial Silesia, and by September, the Swedes had successfully occupied Saxony without resistance. The Treaty of Altranstädt (1706) was concluded between Sweden and Saxony on 14 September. Under Swedish terms, Augustus II was forced to break all ties with his allies, renounce his claims to the Polish crown, and accept Stanisław Leszczyński as the new King.\n[2987730#5] Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld - Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld was the eighth of the Rehnskiölds' eleven children. After his father's death in 1658, Carl Gustav had two brothers and two sisters. The government councilor Philip Christoff von der Lancken and the regional councilor Joachim Cuhn von Owstien, both close friends to Gerdt Rehnskiöld before his death, received custody over the five siblings. The siblings suffered from financial hardship, partly due to Gerdt’s money problems during the latter part of his life, and partly because of inheritance disputes between the five siblings and Gerdt Rehnskiöld's third wife and widow Anna Catharina Gärffelt. The guardians had granted her Birgitta Rehnskiöld's family jewelery and 14,000 riksdaler from the heritage. As a result, the siblings complained about their guardians' way of treating them and wrote several letters of complaint to the Swedish government. Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld's brother-in-law Anders Appelman later came to participate more actively in the upbringing of the five siblings, and gave funds to Carl Gustav's and his brothers' continued education. Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld undertook home education and entered Lund University at the age of 20. Here he studied theology, history, language and philosophy. He participated in lectures with historian and philosopher Samuel von Pufendorf, who took notice of the keen student and offered individual lessons under his tutelage. Pufendorf left a lasting impression. Rehnskiöld re-wrote Pufendorf's work \"Einleitung zur Historie der vornehmsten Reichen und Staaten in Europa\" (printed in Frankfurt only in 1682), provided the manuscript with Pufendorf's personal comments, and kept it for the remainder of his life.\n[2987730#4] Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld - Rehnskiöld was born on 6 August 1651 in Stralsund in Swedish Pomerania. His parents were the government councilor of Pomerania, Gerdt Antoniison Rehnskiöld (1610−1658), originally Keffenbrinck, and Birgitta Torskeskål (died 1655), niece of Baron Johan Adler Salvius. Keffenbrinck's descendants came from Westphalia, and their seat was the castle of Rehne in the northern part of the Münsterland province. Gerdt Rehnskiöld initially served as a scribe in Kammarkollegium, and later as the authorized representative of the Crown at King Gustavus Adolphus' administrative entourage during the King's military campaign in Germany. Thanks to his efforts in the maintenance of the Swedish troops during the Thirty Years War, he became a naturalized Swedish nobleman in 1639 by Queen Kristina and adopted the name Rehnskiöld after his family seat. He was also awarded the Griebenow, Willershusen, and Hohenwarth estates in Pomerania, as well as Stensättra farm in Södermanland. In 1640, the Rehnskiöld family was introduced in the House of Nobility at number 270.\n[2987730#6] Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld - Rehnskiöld joined the Swedish Army at the age of 22, and in 1673 obtained a commission as Ensign at Captain Reinhold Anrep's company in the Närke-Värmland Regiment. Already in the following year, he was appointed Lieutenant at the Queen Dowager of the Realm's Horse Life Regiment. In July 1675, he transferred to the Uppland Regiment, and on 12 February 1676 he became an officer of the prestigious Life Guards.\n[2987730#15] Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld - On January 17, 1697, Rehnskiöld married Elisabeth Funck, daughter of the assessor in Bergskollegium Johan Funck. Rehnskiöld was thus brother-in-law to Carl Magnus Stuart, who was married to his wife's older sister Margaretha Funck. In 1699, a daughter was born to the couple, who died before she was one year old. Rehnskiöld then left Sweden to embark on the Great Northern War, reuniting with his wife on the spring of 1707 in the castle of Altranstädt.\n[2987730#47] Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld - During late autumn 1709, Rehnskiöld and the captured Swedish army were transported to Moscow, where Peter I arranged a massive victory parade on 22 December. The prisoners of war were arranged in ranks, with Rehnskiöld and Piper walking among the last. After the parade, the Swedish prisoners were distributed to cities and prison camps around Russia. Rehnskiöld and Piper moved into Avram Lopuchin's house in Moscow. During a dinner Rehnskiöld had an argument with Piper and Lewenhaupt, where Piper criticized Rehnskiöld's leadership during the battle of Poltava and blamed him for the loss. Piper's insults provoked Rehnskiöld to the point of violence. Lewenhaupt and Gyllenkrok separated them, and Rehnskiöld began accusing Lewenhaupt and the other officers for expressing criticism towards Charles XII:\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Who voiced Ursula?\n\nContexts: [13055668#9] Britt Irvin - Irvin also provided the voice of the character Ursula in the 2007 \"George of the Jungle\" cartoon series which aired on the Cartoon Network, making her the first (and currently only) person ever to voice a cartoon character in a series remake, where the character had originally been voiced by June Foray in the original. Foray had originally voiced the character Ursula in the original \"George of the Jungle\" series from the 1960s – though the character is significantly different in the 2007 series than in the 1967 series. The series aired for only one season.\n[3275887#11] Ursula (The Little Mermaid) - About.com's David Nusair observed that \"There’s no limit to how low Ursula will stoop to achieve her goal\"; the character often relies on a combination of sorcery and deception to achieve them. \"A bargainer of the worst kind\", Ursula only agrees to help the less fortunate when she's confident that she can gain something from them in return. Identifying Ursula as Ariel's binary due to the character's experience and authority, \"Collision of Realities: Establishing Research on the Fantastic in Europe\" author Lars Schmeink described Ursula as a \"more complex and mature character\" than Ariel, embodying everything that the mermaid can potentially become. To Ariel, Ursula represents \"the matronly image\" who \"instigate[s] the young princess' epic journey\" as she longs to achieve the witch's \"sage-like knowledge and power\". Ursula teaches Ariel about womanhood, a theme \"From Mouse to Mermaid: The Politics of Film, Gender, and Culture\" author Elizabeth Belle noticed is absent in Anderson's story. According to Bell, \"Ursula can retrieve Ariel from her destined alliance with patriarchy\", observing that the witch actually \"teaches Ariel that performance and voice and manifestations\" are \"liberations of gender\". \"Teen Ink\"'s Emma James believes that Ursula's death ultimately prevents Ariel from experiencing and learning from the consequences of her actions, concluding, \"Ariel never really owns up to all the mishap she caused.\" Observing that Ursula actually warns Ariel about the consequences should she fail to earn a kiss from Eric, Laura Stampler of \"Time\" described the character as a \"Savvy contract negotiator\". Writing for Collider, Dave Trumbore identified Ursula as the film's \"Crossroads Demon\". According to Gary Thompson of the \"Philadelphia Daily News\", Ursula is similar to businesswoman Leona Helmsley.\n[3275887#14] Ursula (The Little Mermaid) - Ursula debuted in \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989) as a sea witch who is scheming to take advantage of the ambitions of King Triton's youngest daughter Princess Ariel in order to usurp the throne and turning merpeople into polyps for her garden. When Ariel saves and falls in love with a human named Prince Eric much to her father's chagrin, Ursula temporarily grants Ariel's wish to live as a human for three days in return for her voice. If she successfully earns a kiss from Eric by the end of the third day, Ariel will remain human permanently; if she fails, she will turn back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula forever. However, Ursula is determined to sabotage Ariel's and Eric's budding romance at any cost; when she realizes that Ariel and Eric are falling in love, Ursula transforms herself into a beautiful young woman named \"Vanessa\" and hypnotizes Eric, tricking him into agreeing to marry her instead. Ariel manages to thwart Ursula and Eric's wedding. Eric realizes that it was Ariel who saved him when her voice returns to her and is about to kiss her, but as the sun sets Ariel transforms back into a mermaid and is captured by Ursula. Triton confronts Ursula and agrees to give up himself and his magical trident in return for Ariel's freedom. Ursula then uses the trident to expand into monstrous proportions and attempts to kill Ariel and Eric, but Eric manages to impale Ursula with the splintered bowsprit of a wrecked ship, and she dies. With Ursula defeated, her power's cease, the merpeople turn back to normal, Triton's power is restored, and Ariel marries Eric once she is permanently transformed into a human.\n[3275887#6] Ursula (The Little Mermaid) - Ursula is voiced by American actress and comedian Pat Carroll. Carroll was not the filmmakers' first choice for the role; Clements, Musker and Ashman had long debated who should voice the villainness, the casting of whom was long and tedious, spanning an entire year. In his book \"Makin' Toons: Inside the Most Popular Animated TV Shows and Movies\", author Allan Neuwirth documented that the filmmakers searched \"for just the right performer who could put across the deep-voiced, world-weary, deadpan villainness they had in mind–but never quite snaring their catch\". While Ashman was interested in actress Joan Collins because he was a fan of her performance as Alexis Colby in the soap opera \"Dynasty\", Clements and Musker favored actress Bea Arthur, for whom they had actually written the role, describing Ursula as \"having a Bea Arthur-type basso voice\" in early drafts of their screenplay. Clements and Musker expected Arthur to accept the role because she had already been working for Disney's Touchstone Television on the sitcom \"The Golden Girls\". However, Arthur's agent resented the directors-writers for insinuating that her client voice a witch, refusing to even present the script to the actress.\n[3275887#1] Ursula (The Little Mermaid) - Created by directors and screenwriters Ron Clements and John Musker, Ursula is based on the sea witch character who appears in the fairy tale \"The Little Mermaid\" by Hans Christian Andersen. However, her minor role was greatly expanded into that of a much more prominent villain for the film. Disney had struggled to cast Ursula for a year, during which the role was well sought after by several coveted television actresses at the time. Clements and Musker disagreed with lyricist Howard Ashman about who should voice the character. While the directors had written the role with Bea Arthur in mind, Ashman intended to offer it to soap opera star Joan Collins; both actresses rejected the part. When Ashman cast his second choice, Broadway actress Elaine Stritch, as Ursula, both stage veterans disagreed about the manner in which Ursula's song \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" would be performed, and Pat Carroll was finally hired to replace Stritch after Ashman fired her. Deepening her own voice for the role, Carroll based her performance on a combination of Shakespearean actresses and car salespeople.\n[50444775#8] Descendants 2 - On June 10, 2016, China Anne McClain, who was already voicing Freddie on the \"Descendants\" spinoff series \"\", was announced to be playing Ursula's daughter, Uma, in \"Descendants 2\". In July 2016 it was revealed that Thomas Doherty would play the role of Harry, the son of Captain Hook. In August 2016, Sarah Jeffery who portrays Audrey revealed that she would not be returning, while Brenna D'Amico revealed that she would be returning in \"Descendants 2\", as were as Dianne Doan, Jedidiah Goodacre, and Zachary Gibson. On July 19, 2017, it was announced on \"The View\" that Whoopi Goldberg would be providing the voice for Ursula, the Sea Witch and Uma's mother.\n[3275887#0] Ursula (The Little Mermaid) - Ursula is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' 28th animated feature film \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989). Voiced by American actress Pat Carroll, Ursula is a villainous sea witch who tricks a mermaid princess named Ariel into trading her voice for a pair of human legs, at first appearing to be providing the character with an opportunity to become human by temporarily transforming her into one so that she may earn the love of Prince Eric within three days. However, Ursula is, in fact, determined to sabotage Ariel's chances at any expense so that she can ultimately replace the mermaid's father King Triton as ruler over Atlantica.\n[3275887#28] Ursula (The Little Mermaid) - Ursula the Sea Goddess appears in Season 3, where she is voiced by Yvette Nicole Brown. In the episode \"Ariel\", Ursula is described as a sea goddess whom no one has seen for a thousand years. According to Ariel, Ursula gave merfolk the ability to gain legs once a year, when the tide is highest. Ariel uses this ability to visit Prince Eric at his castle, where he is having a ball honoring Ursula. Later, the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla) disguises herself as Ursula in order to make a deal with Ariel and trick her into capturing Snow White. This physical disguise includes short white hair and tentacles, similar to Ursula's animated appearance. Although the Queen considers Ursula to be \"a long-dead octopus\", she is shocked when the real Ursula possesses a statue and warns the queen not to impersonate her again.\n[3275887#31] Ursula (The Little Mermaid) - The episode \"Poor Unfortunate Soul\" contains further flashbacks to Ursula's youth, when she was a teenage mermaid living under the sea with her father King Poseidon (Ernie Hudson). Ursula was gifted with a beautiful voice, which Poseidon wanted her to use to lure pirates to their death, in order to avenge the murder of Ursula's mother at the hands of an unnamed pirate. Ursula refused and instead befriended a pirate, Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue), who supported her desire for freedom. Ursula and Hook's friendship fell apart when Hook sealed Ursula's singing voice inside an enchanted shell, in order to punish Poseidon for destroying a weapon Hook wanted for himself. Ursula, angered and disappointed with both merfolk and humans, used Poseidon's trident to transform her tail into tentacles, emulating the ancient sea goddess that she was named after.\n[3275887#8] Ursula (The Little Mermaid) - Carroll first learned of \"The Little Mermaid\" from her agent, and immediately agreed to audition for Ursula because she had always wanted to voice a Disney character. However, the actress felt that her chances were slim to none upon realizing that her competition largely consisted of famous film and television actresses. Musker described Carroll's audition approach as a hybrid of actors Maurice Evans and Tallulah Bankhead. Although confident in both her acting and singing auditions, Carroll did not hear back from her agent about the role until a year afterward, by which time she had already forgotten she had ever auditioned. Upon being cast, Carroll was entirely committed to the role, giving it complete precedence over all other jobs and projects at the time. Carroll's first task was to record \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\", her approach to which was remarkably different than Stritch's, first asking Howard to demonstrate exactly how he would like her to perform the song before attempting it. Carroll completely credits Ashman with her delivery, explaining, \"I got the whole attitude from him ... and his shoulders would twitch a certain way, and his eyes would go a certain way ... I got more about that character from Howard singing that song than from anything else.\" Carroll also borrowed Ursula's habit of saying \"innit\" instead of \"isn't it\" from Ashman. Despite their strong working relationship, Carroll described working with Ashman and composer Alan Menken as a \"brutal\" experience because of the songwriters' \"military\" approach; she would often return home from recording sessions with blown vocal chords. Carroll recalled her daughter, filmmaker Tara Karsian, reassuring her that \"you're in something that fifty years from now may be shown ... What you're working on now will be seen by our children, and our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren\" after complaining to her about one of her recording sessions. Describing her own performance as Shakespearean, Carroll perceived Ursula as an \"ex-Shakespearean actress who now sold cars\", which inspired her dry, theatrical interpretation. Carroll also deepened her own voice for the role. When Carroll watched the completed film for the first time, she was frightened by her own performance, comparing it to actress Margaret Hamilton's performance as the Wicked Witch of the West in the film \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Actress Jodi Benson, who voices Ariel, briefly provides the voice of \"Vanessa\", Ursula's beautiful human alter-ego, in lieu of Carroll. With the writing and recording of \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\", Ursula became the first Disney villainness to receive her own song.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

He was a career Artillery officer. In 1943 he was appointed to the 2nd Corps \"Command in Gallipoli\". During the 2nd Corps Command, he sold his house for the Turkish soldiers who were martyred in the Battle of Gallipoli, and built a monumental grave. He served as Chief of General Staff between 1950-1954 for a four-year period. It is the first commander-in-chief of the Turkish Land Forces Command since the transition from the Ottoman army to the modern-regular army. He then retired and entered the Parliament from the Justice Party. TBMM X. and XI. He is a deputy in Istanbul.\n[4840334#0] Hüseyin Kıvrıkoğlu - Hüseyin Kıvrıkoğlu (born 1934) is a retired Turkish general who was the Commander of the Turkish Armed Forces and on August 30, 1998, became Chief of the Turkish General Staff for a four-year term.\n[1733276#0] Turkish Land Forces - The Turkish Land Forces (), or Turkish Army (), is the main branch of the Turkish Armed Forces responsible for land-based military operations. Official sources trace the army's foundation to Modu Chanyu of the Xiongnu Empire in 209 BC, but the modern history of the army began with its formation after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Significant events since the foundation of the army include combat in the Korean War and in the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and acting as a NATO bulwark along Cold War frontiers through 1992. The army holds the preeminent place within the armed forces. It is customary for the Chief of the General Staff of the Republic of Turkey to have been the Commander of the Turkish Land Forces prior to his appointment as Turkey's senior ranking officer. Alongside the other two armed services, the Turkish Army has frequently intervened in Turkish politics, which has now been regulated to an extent with the reform of the National Security Council. The current commander of the Turkish Land Forces is General Yaşar Güler.\n[32664231#6] Necdet Özel - As a General, he served as the Commander of Aegean Army between 2007–2008, as the Commander of the 2nd Army between 2008–2010, and as the Commander of Gendarmerie between 2010–2011. After serving as the Commander of TLFC and as the Acting Commander of the Turkish Armed Forces between 29 July and 4 August 2011, he assumed the command of Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) on 4 August 2011. Between 4 August 2011 and 18 August 2015, he serves as the 28th Chief of the Turkish General Staff, succeeded by Hulusi Akar.\n[254428#84] Commander-in-chief - President of the Republic of Turkey has the constitutional right to represent the Supreme Military Command of the Turkish Armed Forces, on behalf of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, and to decide on the mobilization of the Turkish Armed Forces, to appoint the Chief of the General Staff, to call the National Security Council to meet, to preside over the National Security Council, to proclaim martial law or state of emergency, and to issue decrees having the force of law, upon a decision of the Council of Ministers meeting under his/her chairmanship. With all these issues above written in the Constitution of Turkey, the executive rights are given to the President of the Republic of Turkey to be represented as the commander-in-chief of the nation.\n[1239586#6] General Staff of the Republic of Turkey - According to the constitution, the office of the 'Commander in Chief' is represented in the spiritual entity of the Grand National Assembly. The Chief of the General Staff is appointed by the President as the Commander of the Armed Forces. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Grand National Assembly for national security and the preparation of the Turkish Armed Forces to defend the country. However, the authority to declare a state of war and send the Turkish Armed Forces to foreign countries or allow foreign armed forces to be stationed in Turkey require a vote of approval from the Turkish Parliament.\n[30205#36] Turkish Armed Forces - On the eve of the Supreme Military Council of August 2011, the Chief of the General Staff, along with the Army, Navy, and Air Force commanders, requested their retirement, in protest of the mass arrests which they perceived as a deliberate and planned attack against the Kemalist and secular-minded officers of the Turkish Armed Forces by the Islamists in Turkey, who began to control key positions in the Turkish government, judiciary and police. The swift replacement of the force commanders in the Supreme Military Council meeting affirmed the government's control over the appointment of top-level commanders. However, promotions continue to be determined by the General Staff with limited civilian control. The European Commission, in its 2011 regular yearly report on Turkey's progress towards EU accession, stated that \"further reforms on the composition and powers of the Supreme Military Council, particularly on the legal basis of promotions, still need to materialise.\" The service branch commanders continue to report to the Prime Minister instead of the Defence Minister.\nIn July 2016, various factions of the Turkish Armed Forces attempted to take over the government, but Erdogan supporters stopped the coup attempt. Many lives were lost and hundreds were injured. Thousands of military personnel have been arrested and structure of the armed forces has been overhauled.\n[32664231#0] Necdet Özel - General Necdet Özel (born 1950) is a Turkish Army general, who served as the 28th Chief of the General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces. He also served as the commander of the Turkish Land Forces. General Necdet Özel is only the second in this position not to have NATO experience.\n[47439541#0] Hulusi Akar - Hulusi Akar (born 12 March 1952) is the current Turkish Minister of Defence and a former four-star Turkish Armed Forces general who served as the 29th Chief of the General Staff.

    "prompt": "Question: How large is the Sahara desert?\n\nContexts: [14612089#19] Desertec - The annual average insolation, which represents the total amount of solar radiation energy received on a given area and on a giver period, is about 2,500 kWh/(m² year) over the region and this number can soar up to almost 3,000 kWh/(m² year) in the best cases. The weather features of the Sahara Desert, especially the insolation, have a pronounced nature. The annual electricity production reaches 1,300,000 TWh at maximum in this sun-drenched area if the whole desert is covered in solar panels.\nThe desert is also extremely vast covering about some 9,000,000 km² (3,474,920 sq mi), being almost as large as China or the United States and is sparsely populated, making it possible to set up large solar farms without a negative impact on inhabitants of the region, too. Lastly, sand deserts can provide silicon, a raw material that is essential in the production of solar panels.\n[27068#0] Sahara Desert (ecoregion) - The Sahara Desert ecoregion, as defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), includes the hyper-arid center of the Sahara, between 18° and 30° N. It is one of several desert and xeric shrubland ecoregions that cover the northern portion of the African continent.\n[14612089#18] Desertec - The Sahara Desert was chosen as an ideal location for solar farms as it is exposed to bright sunshine nearly all the time, roughly between 80% and 97% of the daylight hours in the best cases. This is the sunniest year-round area on the planet. In the world's largest hot desert, there is an extremely vast area, covering almost the whole desert, that receives more than 3,600 h of yearly sunshine. There is also a very large area in excess of 4,000 h of sunshine annually. The highest solar radiation received on the planet is in the Sahara Desert, under the Tropic of Cancer. This results from a general, strong lack of cloud cover year-round and a geographical position under the tropics.\n[18955999#46] Desert - The potential for generating solar energy from the Sahara Desert is huge, the highest found on the globe. Professor David Faiman of Ben-Gurion University has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world's electricity needs from 10% of the Sahara Desert. Desertec Industrial Initiative was a consortium seeking $560 billion to invest in North African solar and wind installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to Europe via cable lines running under the Mediterranean Sea. European interest in the Sahara Desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land. The Sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe. The Sahara Desert also has the empty space totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields of mirrors for solar plants.\n[27068#4] Sahara Desert (ecoregion) - The surface of the desert ranges from large areas of sand dunes (erg), to stone plateaus (hamadas), gravel plains (reg), dry valleys (wadis), and salt flats. The only permanent river that crosses the ecoregion is the Nile River, which originates in central Africa and empties northwards into the Mediterranean Sea. Some areas encompass vast underground aquifers resulting in oases, while other regions severely lack water reserves.\nThe Sahara Desert features a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification \"BWh\"). The Sahara Desert is one of the driest and hottest regions of the world, with a mean temperature sometimes over and the average high temperatures in summer are over for months at a time, and can even soar to . In desert rocky mountains such as the Tibesti in Libya or the Hoggar in Algeria, average highs in summer are slightly moderated by the high elevation and are between at elevation. Daily variations may also be extreme: a swing from has been observed. Typical temperature swings are between .\n[14612089#30] Desertec - As also parts of the desert regions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) come with high wind potential, Dii is examining in which geographic regions the installation of wind farms is suitable. Wind turbines produce electricity by wind turning the blades, which spin a shaft, which connects to a generator which produces electricity. The Sahara Desert is one of the windiest areas on the planet, especially on the western coast where lies the Atlantic coastal desert along Western Sahara and Mauritania. The annual average wind speed at the ground greatly exceeds 5 m/s in most of the desert, and even approach 8 m/s or 9 m/s along the western ocean coast. It's important to note that wind speed increases with height. The regularity and the constancy of winds in arid regions are major assets for wind energy, too. The winds blow nearly constantly over the desert and there are generally no windless days during throughout the year. Therefore, the desert of North Africa is also an ideal location to install large-scale wind parks and wind turbines with very good productivity.\n[21714#4] North Africa - South of the Atlas Mountains is the dry and barren expanse of the Sahara desert, which is the largest sand desert in the world. In places the desert is cut by irregular watercourses called wadis—streams that flow only after rainfalls but are usually dry. The Sahara’s major landforms include ergs, large seas of sand that sometimes form into huge dunes; the hammada, a level rocky plateau without soil or sand; and the reg, a level plain of gravel or small stones. The Sahara covers the southern part of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and most of Libya. Only two regions of Libya are outside the desert: Tripolitania in the northwest and Cyrenaica in the northeast. Most of Egypt is also desert, with the exception of the Nile River and the irrigated land along its banks. The Nile Valley forms a narrow fertile thread that runs along the length of the country.\n[325363#46] Sahara - The Kiffian culture is a prehistoric industry, or domain, that existed between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago in the Sahara, during the Neolithic Subpluvial. Human remains from this culture were found in 2000 at a site known as Gobero, located in Niger in the Ténéré Desert. The site is known as the largest and earliest grave of Stone Age people in the Sahara desert. The Kiffians were skilled hunters. Bones of many large savannah animals that were discovered in the same area suggest that they lived on the shores of a lake that was present during the Holocene Wet Phase, a period when the Sahara was verdant and wet. The Kiffian people were tall, standing over six feet in height. Craniometric analysis indicates that this early Holocene population was closely related to the Late Pleistocene Iberomaurusians and early Holocene Capsians of the Maghreb, as well as mid-Holocene Mechta groups. Traces of the Kiffian culture do not exist after 8,000 years ago, as the Sahara went through a dry period for the next thousand years. After this time, the Tenerian culture colonized the area.\n[27068#1] Sahara Desert (ecoregion) - The Sahara Desert is the world's largest hot desert, located in North Africa. It stretches from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. The vast desert encompasses several ecologically distinct regions. The Sahara Desert ecoregion covers an area of in the hot, hyper-arid center of the Sahara, surrounded on the north, south, east, and west by desert ecoregions with higher rainfall and more vegetation.\n[7331512#1] Apostolic Vicariate of Sahara - The Sahara is a vast desert of northern Africa, measuring about 932 miles from north to south and 2484 miles from east to west, and dotted with oases which are centres of population. Eight years after the journey of the French explorer Henri Duveyrier (1859–61), which had important scientific results, Pope Pius IX on 6 August 1868 appointed the Archbishop of Algiers, Mgr Charles Lavigerie, delegate Apostolic of the Sahara and the Sudan. In the same year the Jesuits established themselves at Laghouat, the extremity occupied by French arms. In 1871 they sent to Mgr Lavigerie a long report in which they advocated the establishment of dispensaries and schools. In 1872 Father Charmetant and two other White Fathers (Missionary Fathers of Africa of Algiers) replaced the Jesuits at Laghouat. In 1873 the White Fathers established themselves at Biskra, Ouargla, Touggart and Gerryville. Later a station was founded at Melili in M'zab.\nTwo successive attempts were made by the White Fathers to reach the Sudan region by crossing the Sahara, thus reaching Timbuktu, a large market for black slaves, there to join in the struggle against slavery. The first attempt was made in December, 1878, by Fathers Menoret, Paulmier and Bouchand; they were slain in April, 1876 by their Touarag guides, being the first martyrs of the Society of White Fathers, and the cause of their beatification was introduced at Rome in 1909. After this disaster the White Fathers founded two stations, not farther north in the desert, but to the north-east, at Tripoli and Ghadames, both in Libya. The massacre of the explorer Flatters and his companions (1880–81) did not discourage the White Fathers in their second attempt to cross the Sahara. In 1881 Father Richard set out from Ghadames, having become so Arabian in speech and bearing that no one suspected his nationality. He intended to establish himself with Fathers Morat and Pouplard at Ghat in the midst of the Libyan desert, but all three were assassinated.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

According to The Statesman Anne Elizabeth Wynn claims \"The two most recent American Religious Identification Surveys declare Wicca, one form of paganism, as the fastest growing spiritual identification in America\". Mary Jones claims Wicca is one of the fastest-growing religions in the United States as well. Wicca, which is largely a \"Pagan\" religion primarily attracts followers of nature-based religions in, as an example, the Southeast Valley region of the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area.\n[7809444#16] Growth of religion - According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, an increasing number of Americans are leaving their faith and becoming unaffiliated. By 2050, Christianity is expected to remain the majority in the United states (66.4%, down from 78.3% in 2010), and the number of Christians in absolute number is expected to grow from 243 million to 262 million.\nAccording to a 2005 paper submitted to a meeting of the American Political Science Association, most of Christianity's growth has occurred in non-Western countries. The paper concludes that the Pentecostalism movement is the fastest-growing religion worldwide. Protestantism is growing as a result of historic missionary activity and indigenous Christian movements by Africans in Africa, and due primarily to conversion in Asia, Latin America, Muslim world, and Oceania. According to Pew Research Center, Christianity is declining in the United states while non-Christian faiths are growing.\n[7809444#17] Growth of religion - The US Department of State estimated in 2005 that Protestants in Vietnam may have grown by 600% over the previous 10 years. In South Korea, Christianity has grown from 2.0% in 1945 to 20.7% in 1985 and to 29.3% in 2010, And the Catholic Church has increased its membership by 70% in the last ten years. In Singapore, the percentage of Christians among Singaporeans increased from 12.7%, in 1990, to 17.5%, in 2010. In recent years, the number of Chinese Christians has increased significantly; Christians were 4 million before 1949 (3 million Catholics and 1 million Protestants), and are reaching 67 million today, Christianity is reportedly the fastest growing religion in China with average annual rate of 7%. Some reports also show that many of the Chinese Indonesians minority convert to Christianity, Demographer Aris Ananta reported in 2008 that \"anecdotal evidence suggests that more Buddhist Chinese have become Christians as they increased their standards of education\". According to a poll conducted by the Gallup Organization in 2006, Christianity has increased significantly in Japan, particularly among youth, and a high number of teens are becoming Christians. In Iran, Christianity is reportedly the fastest growing religion with an average annual rate of 5.2%.\n[7809444#2] Growth of religion - World religions statistics place the Bahá'í Faith around 0.1% of the world population in recent years. The \"World Christian Encyclopedia\" estimated only 7.1 million Bahá'ís in the world in 2000, representing 218 countries, and its evolution to the \"World Christian Database\" (WCD) estimated 7.3 million in 2010 while accredited through the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA). However the WCD stated: \"The Baha'i Faith is the only religion to have grown faster in every United Nations region over the past 100 years than the general population; Baha'i [sic] was thus the fastest-growing religion between 1910 and 2010, growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region.\" This source's only documented flaw was to consistently have a higher estimate of Christians than in other cross-national data sets. 2015's estimate is of 7.8 million Bahá'ís in the world.\n[7809444#1] Growth of religion - Studies in the 21st century show that, in terms of percentage and worldwide spread, Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world. A religious forecast for 2050 by Pew Research Center concludes that global Muslim population is expected to grow at a faster rate than the non-Muslim population due primarily to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims. Religious conversion has little impact on Muslim population because the number of people who convert to Islam is nearly offset by those who leave Islam.\n[23077926#2] God is Back - Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that the religions growing around the world tend to exhibit these same features. World religions—and Christianity, in particular—are growing fastest where they are: competing with other religious alternatives, unsupported by state governments, and entirely dependent upon popular interest. Writing against the fear that the growth of religion will increase warfare and strife, Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that a democratic and pluralistic culture would help minimize these dangers while maximizing the benefits of religion. Finally, while the authors suggest that Islam too could be modernized and introduced to a pluralistic culture, they suspect that Islam is less amenable for this transition than Christianity.\n[33870721#3] Lunopolis - Interviewees describe the Church of Lunology, which claims to be the fastest growing religion. Members believe that a civilization lives on the moon, and the US government has been covering it up. While Matt and Sonny investigate a Church of Lunology building, one of their camera operators, Nate, takes exterior shots. Separately, both groups are confronted by Church of Lunology members, who demand the return of their time machine. The filmmakers regroup and flee, chased by the Lunology members. Unable to outrun the Lunology members, the filmmakers stop their car and demand an explanation. Instead, the Lunology members' car takes off into the sky. Stunned and unsure of what happened, the filmmakers debate what to do next.\n[4163014#34] Religion in Europe - Buddhism is thinly spread throughout Europe, and the fastest growing religion in recent years with about 3 million adherents. In Kalmykia, Tibetan Buddhism is prevalent.\n[28632#47] Seventh-day Adventist Church - G. Jeffrey MacDonald, an award-winning religion reporter, and author of \"Thieves in the Temple,\" reports that the SDA church is the fastest-growing church in the United States. \"Newly released data show Seventh-day Adventism growing by 2.5% in North America, a rapid clip for this part of the world, where Southern Baptists and mainline denominations, as well as other church groups, are declining.\"\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What is the Christian population of Israel?\n\nContexts: [9282173#56] Israel - Making up 17.6% of the population, Muslims constitute Israel's largest religious minority. About 2% of the population is Christian and 1.6% is Druze. The Christian population primarily comprises Arab Christians, but also includes post-Soviet immigrants, the foreign laborers of multinational origins, and followers of Messianic Judaism, considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity. Members of many other religious groups, including Buddhists and Hindus, maintain a presence in Israel, albeit in small numbers. Out of more than one million immigrants from the former Soviet Union, about 300,000 are considered not Jewish by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.\nThe city of Jerusalem is of special importance to Jews, Muslims and Christians as it is the home of sites that are pivotal to their religious beliefs, such as the Old City that incorporates the Western Wall and the Temple Mount, the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Other locations of religious importance in Israel are Nazareth (holy in Christianity as the site of the Annunciation of Mary), Tiberias and Safed (two of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism), the White Mosque in Ramla (holy in Islam as the shrine of the prophet Saleh), and the Church of Saint George in Lod (holy in Christianity and Islam as the tomb of Saint George or Al Khidr). A number of other religious landmarks are located in the West Bank, among them Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, the birthplace of Jesus and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, and the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron. The administrative center of the Bahá'í Faith and the Shrine of the Báb are located at the Bahá'í World Centre in Haifa; the leader of the faith is buried in Acre. A few miles south of the Bahá'í World Centre is Mahmood Mosque affiliated with the reformist Ahmadiyya movement. Kababir, Haifa's mixed neighbourhood of Jews and Ahmadi Arabs is the only one of its kind in the country.\n[15004448#5] Christianity in Israel - The Christian population in Israel has increased significantly with the immigration of many mixed families from the former Soviet Union (1989-late 1990s) and by the influx of some 10,000 Christian Maronites from Lebanon in 2000. Recently a further increase in Christianity came with arrival of many foreign workers and asylum seekers, some of Christian background (for instance from the Philippines and South Sudan). As a result, numerous churches have opened in Tel Aviv.\n[15004448#0] Christianity in Israel - Christianity is one of the recognized religions in Israel and is practiced, as of December 2016, by more than 169,000 Israeli citizens (about 2.0% of the population). They include 133,000 Arab Christians who are mostly adherents of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church (about 60% of Israeli Christians) or the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, as well as Latin Rite Catholics, with small numbers of Maronites, Arameans, Copts, and Protestants, about 25,000 Orthodox Christians from the former Soviet Union (Russian Orthodox) and smaller minorities of Assyrians and Armenians. A certain number of Israelis also practice Messianic Judaism—usually considered a syncretist form of Christianity, with estimates of several thousands, but exact numbers of such are not available.\n[15004448#24] Christianity in Israel - This new attitude is founded largely by the perception by some that only in Israel the Christian population is growing due to natural increase and no state persecution, seeing the entire Middle East, except Lebanon, as where Christianity is and has been rapidly on the decline. In addition, increasing numbers of Christian leaders and community members are pointing to Muslim violence as a threat to their way of life in Arab majority cities and towns. Sons of the New Testament as a party and a national movement has been met with wide admiration from the Jews of Israel, harshly negative scorn from the Muslim Arabs, and mixed reactions from the Christians themselves. Because of Israel's parliamentary system where each party must attain at least 2% of the popular vote, Sons of the New Testament must be supported by non-Christians to enter the Knesset.\n[23949#18] Palestinian Christians - After the war of 1948, the Christian population in the West Bank, under Jordanian control, dropped slightly, largely due to economic problems. This contrasts with the process occurring in Israel where Christians left \"en masse\" after 1948. Constituting 21% of Israel's Arab population in 1950, they now make up just 9% of that group. These trends accelerated after the 1967 war in the aftermath of Israel's takeover of the West Bank and Gaza.\n[15004448#36] Christianity in Israel - In terms of their socio-economic situation, Arab Christians are more similar to the Jewish population than to the Muslim Arab population. They have the lowest incidence of poverty and the lowest percentage of unemployment which is 4.9% compared to 6.5% among Jewish men and women. They have also the highest median household income among Arab citizens of Israel and second highest median household income among the Israeli ethno-religious groups. Also Arab Christians have a high presentation in science and in the white collar professions. In Israel, Arab Christians are portrayed as a hard-working and upper-middle-class educated ethno-religious minority.\n[2868695#36] Religion in Israel - According to historical and traditional sources, Jesus lived in the Land of Israel, and died and was buried on the site of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, making the land a Holy Land for Christianity. However, few Christians now live in the area, compared to Muslims and Jews. This is because Islam displaced Christianity in almost all of the Middle East, and the rise of modern Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel has seen millions of Jews migrate to Israel. Recently, the Christian population in Israel has increased with the immigration of foreign workers from a number of countries, and the immigration of accompanying non-Jewish spouses in mixed marriages. Numerous churches have opened in Tel Aviv.\n[492331#32] Arab citizens of Israel - Christian Arabs comprise about 9% of the Arab population in Israel. Approximately 70% reside in the north, in Jish, Eilabun, Kafr Yasif, Kafr Kanna, I'billin, Shefa-'Amr. Some Druze villages, such as Hurfeish and Maghar, have small Christian Arab populations. Nazareth has the largest Christian Arab population. The near entirety of Haifa's Arab minority is Christian as well. There are 117,000 or more Christian Arabs in Israel (and more than 35,000 non-Arab Christians). As of 2014 the Melkite Greek Catholic Church was the largest Christian community in Israel, where about 60% of Israeli Christians belonged to the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, while around 30% of Israeli Christians belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem.\n[793911#24] Arab Christians - In December 2009, 122,000 Arab Christians lived in Israel, as Arab citizens of Israel, out of a total of 151,700 Christian citizens. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, on the eve of Christmas 2013, there were approximately 161,000 Christians in Israel, about 2 percent of the general population in Israel 80% of the Christians are of Arabic roots with smaller Christian communities of ethnic Russians, Greeks, Armenians, Maronites, Ukrainians and Assyrians. The majority of Arab Christians in Israel belong to the Greek Orthodox Church, with a sizable minority belonging to the Greek Catholic (Melkite) and Latin Churches. Other denominations are the Anglicans who have their cathedral church in the contested territory of East Jerusalem. Baptists in Israel are concentrated in the north of the country, and have four churches in the Nazareth area, and a seminary.\n[27540993#15] Secularism in Israel - The next largest minority population is the Christian population (2%), many of whom live with Jewish communities. Rather than have their own education and medical institutions they have integrated into state institutions. The Christian population in Israel is the only Christian population in the Middle East that has grown in the last half century. Christians choose to live in Israel because they have freedom of speech and the freedom to practice religion.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

It is the principal language of education and government and is spoken throughout the country. The standard is written in the Thai alphabet, an abugida that evolved from the Khmer script. However, Central Thais speak an folk language in Central (including the metropolitan area), Eastern, Southwestern Thailand and Nakhon Ratchasima Province.\n[4409360#0] Thai Sign Language - Thai Sign Language (TSL) or Modern Standard Thai Sign Language (MSTSL), is the national sign language of Thailand's deaf community and is used in most parts of the country by the 20 percent of the estimated 56,000 pre-linguistically deaf people who go to school. Thai Sign Language was acknowledged as \"the national language of deaf people in Thailand\" in August 1999, in a resolution signed by the Minister of Education on behalf of the Royal Thai Government. As with many sign languages, the means of transmission to children occurs within families with signing deaf parents and in schools for the deaf. A robust process of language teaching and acculturation among deaf children has been documented and photographed in the Thai residential schools for the deaf.\n[48647#2] Thai language - Thai is the official language of Thailand, natively spoken by, according to Ethnologue, over 20 million people (2000). In reality, the number of native Thai speakers is likely to be much higher, since the Thai people of ethnic Chinese origins throughout the country learn it as their first language. The populations of western and eastern parts of Thailand, which had since ancient time formed the core territory of Siam, also speak central Thai as their first language. Moreover, most Thais in the northern and the northeastern (Isaan) parts of the country today are bilingual speakers of Central Thai and their respective regional dialects due to the fact that (Central) Thai is the language of television, education, news reporting, and all forms of media. A recent research finds that the speakers of Northern Thai language (or Kham Mueang) have become so few, as most people in northern Thailand now invariably speak standard Thai, such that they are now using mostly central Thai words and seasoning their speech only with \"kham mueang\" accent. Standard Thai is based on Ayutthaya dialect, and register in the educated classes.\nIn addition to Central Thai, Thailand is home to other related Tai languages. Although some linguists classify these dialects as related but distinct languages, there is a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these regional dialects/languages. Nonetheless, it is often claimed that the language policy of the Thai government has shaped the dominant view that these languages are only regional variants or dialects of the \"same\" Thai language, or as \"different kinds of Thai\".\nCentral Thai is composed of several distinct registers, forms for different social contexts:\n[15735696#2] Languages of Thailand - The Thai hill tribes speak numerous small languages, many Chinese retain varieties of Chinese, and there are half a dozen sign languages. The Ethnologue reports 73 living languages are used in Thailand. The Royal Thai Government's 2011 Country Report to the Committee Responsible for the \"International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination\", relying mainly on the 2005 Ethnolinguistic Maps of Thailand data, lists 62 languages.\n[30131#18] Demographics of Thailand - The following table shows official first languages in Thailand with 400,000 or more speakers according to the Royal Thai Government's 2011 Country Report to the Committee Responsible for the \"International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination\".\nThe following table employs 2000 census data. Caution should be exercised with Thai census data on first language. In Thai censuses, the four largest Tai-Kadai languages of Thailand (in order, Central Thai, Isan (majority Lao), Kam Mueang, Pak Tai) are not provided as options for language or ethnic group. People declaring one of these as a first language, including Lao, are assigned to \"Thai\". This explains the disparity between the two tables. For instance, self-reporting as Lao has been prohibited, due to the prohibition of the Lao ethnonym in the context of describing Thai citizens for approximately one hundred years. This was due to the promotion of \"Thai\" national identity to cement Siamese claims over the Lao city-states of what is now northern and northeast Thailand following the 1893 Franco Siamese War and subsequent threats posed by French Indochina to the Lao tributary states of Siam. The birth of a homogenizing Thai ethnocentric national identity sufficient to begin transforming Siam from an absolute monarchy into a modern nation-state was achieved by assimilating the Lao with this Thai \"identity\", equivalent to what is now known as the Tai–Kadai_languages, under a \"Greater Thai Empire\", and can be traced back to at least 1902. This homogenization began affecting the Thai census from 1904 onwards. The 2011 UN report data is therefore more comprehensive and better differentiates between the large Tai-Kadai languages of Thailand. As a country submission to a UN convention ratified by Thailand, it is also arguably more authoritative.\n[501222#15] Isan language - The Lao (Isan) language in Thailand is classified by \"Ethnologue\" as a \"\"de facto\" language of provincial identity\" which is defined as a language that \"is the language of identity for citizens of the province, but this is not mandated by law. Neither is it developed enough or known enough to function as the language of government business.\" It continues to be an important regional language for the ethnic Lao and other minorities that live beside them, but it does not have any official status in Thailand. Although the population of Lao speakers is much smaller in Laos, the language there enjoys official status, and it is the primary language of government, business, education, and inter-ethnic communication. Even with close proximity to Laos, Isan speakers must master Thai and very few Isan people can read the Lao script due to lack of exposure.\n[30128#116] Thailand - The official language of Thailand is Thai, a Tai–Kadai language closely related to Lao, Shan in Myanmar, and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from Hainan and Yunnan south to the Chinese border. It is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout the country. The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the Thai alphabet, an abugida script that evolved from the Khmer alphabet.\n[501222#12] Isan language - The Isan language is spoken in the 20 provinces that make up the Isan region of north-eastern Thailand, approximately the size of England and Wales combined. It is also the native language of large portions of Uttaradit and Phitsanulok provinces of Northern Thailand and northern areas of most provinces of Eastern Thailand that border the Isan region. The preservation of the Lao language in Isan was aided by its isolation, as the region was separated from Thai speakers by the Phetchabun and Dong Phaya Yen mountain ranges to the west and the Sankamphaeng Range to the south-west of Isan. Lao speakers, as well as speakers of the archaic Northern Khmer language, were separated from Khmer speakers by the Dângrêk Mountains to the south. To the north and east of the region, the Mekong River serves as the 'boundary' with the Lao language proper as spoken in Laos, although the border has always been fairly porous with thousands of people crossing to the river every day for trade, travel and business.\n[15735696#0] Languages of Thailand - An ethnolinguistic map of Thailand. Thailand, and its neighbor Laos, are dominated by languages of the Southwestern Tai family. Karen languages are spoken along the border with Burma, Khmer is spoken near Cambodia and Malay in the south near Malaysia. The following table comprises all 62 ethnic groups recognised by the Royal Thai Government in the 2011 Country Report to the UN Committee responsible for the \"International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination\", available from the Department of Rights and Liberties Promotion of the Thai Ministry of Justice.\n[15735696#11] Languages of Thailand - The following table employs 2000 census data. Caution should be exercised with Thai census data on first language. In Thai censuses, the four largest Tai-Kadai languages of Thailand (in order, Central Thai, Isan (majority Lao), Kam Mueang, Pak Tai) are not provided as options for language or ethnic group. People stating such a language as a first language, including Lao, are allocated to 'Thai'. This explains the disparity between the two tables. For instance, self-reporting as Lao has been prohibited, due to the prohibition of the Lao ethnonym in the context of describing Thai citizens, for approximately one hundred years. This was due to the promotion of a 'Thai' national identity to cement Siamese claims over the Lao city-states of what is now Northern and Northeast Thailand following the 1893 Franco Siamese War and subsequent threat posed by French Indochina to Lao tributary states of Siam. Some historian argued that the birth of a homogenizing Thai ethnocentric national identity sufficient to begin transforming Siam from an absolute monarchy into a modern nation-state was achieved by assimilating the Lao within this Thai 'identity', equivalent to what is now known as the Tai–Kadai_languages, under a 'Greater Thai Empire', and can be traced back to at least 1902. But this view neglects the fact that \"Lao\", as a unified ethnic group, was also created by the French in order to sever the Siamese influence over Lan Xang and to justify the annexation of \"Laos\" -- as a created territory -- to its Indochinese \"protectorate.\" The 2011 Country Report data is therefore more comprehensive and better differentiates between the large Tai-Kadai languages of Thailand. As a country submission to a UN convention ratified by Thailand, it is also arguably more authoritative. ไทย\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When was the Stuttgart US Army base created?\n\nContexts: [6733634#1] Patch Barracks - Patch Barracks was renamed from the German \"Kurmärker Kaserne\" in 1952; it was originally built for use by the German Army [Heer] in 1936-1937. During World War II, it served as the headquarters and barracks for the Wehrmacht's 7th Panzer Regiment with associated unit shooting ranges and training areas located at the nearby Panzer Kaserne (literally \"tank barracks\"). After the Second World War, Kurmärker Kaserne was temporarily occupied by French colonial troops. Subsequently, American troops took over the facility, which hosted the US Constabulary during the multilateral occupation of Germany following World War II. The US 7th Army was headquartered here from 1950 until 1967 when EUCOM was relocated to Patch from Camp-de-Loges near Paris, France. 7th Army relocated to Heidelberg.DODEA (formerly DoDDS) operates Patch Middle School for the dependent children of service members.\n[28565#35] Stuttgart - In March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a Headquarters at Kurmärker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the Headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.\n[31268314#3] Stuttgart-Rohr–Filderstadt railway - In 1955, passenger services on the Stuttgart-Rohr–Echterdingen (–Neuhausen) line and on the Siebenmühlen Valley line were replaced by bus services; the line was now only used for freight traffic. The supplying of fuel and other goods to the airport by rail was abandoned by the end of the 1960s. At the same time the proposed Echterdingen link road was abandoned during the planning of the new Federal Highway 27 and the proposed use of the southern part of the military airport by the U.S. Army did not materialise due to community opposition. On 28 May 1983, freight traffic on the Leinfelden–Neuhausen section was closed and the tracks on the SSB-owned route from Echterdingen to Neuhausen were soon removed. The tracks on the Deutsche Bahn section from Leinfelden to Echterdingen were closed for rebuilding in preparation for the S-Bahn a few years later. The last train to run on the original line before the reopening for the S-Bahn was an Uerdingen railbus from Echterdingenran in September 1985 during a special trip for the inauguration of the S-Bahn to Stuttgart-Vaihingen. The remaining Rohr–Leinfelden section was still used occasionally for shunting freight until the early 1990s. It was used mainly to serve Leinfelden-based companies, but also for the transport of construction materials for the S-Bahn. The line was reconstructed for the S-Bahn from the mid-1980s, with the installation of double track, electrification and the partial undergrounding of the track. Curves were also straightened. A new line was created between Echterdingen and the airport.\n[16958693#1] Stuttgart Municipal Airport - Stuttgart Municipal Airport dates to 1942 when it was built by the United States Army Air Forces. It was used as an advanced twin-engine flying school and glider training. With the end of World War II, Stuttgart Army Airfield was declared excess and closed on 5 August 1946. It was conveyed though the War Assets Administration (WAA) to the City of Stuttgart to establish a municipal airport.\n[16853992#3] Hazen Municipal Airport - The airport was built by the United States Army Air Forces during 1942/43 as an axillary airfield for Stuttgart Army Airfield, near Stuttgart, Arkansas. It was known simply as Stuttgart Army Airfield Auxiliary #2. The runways in use today were built during that period. It was used to help train medium bomber and transport pilots, who used it for emergencies on it or practiced touch-and-go landings. It was not manned, and at the end of World War II it was simply abandoned and the land turned over to local authorities, like many other small auxiliary airfields.\n[22776054#1] Stuttgart Army Air Field (Arkansas) - Stuttgart Municipal Airport dates to 1942 when it was built by the United States Army Air Forces as a training airfield as part of the 70,000 Pilot Training Program. It was one of many air fields created in the country’s interior during the war. The airfield consisted of four main 5'000 ft concrete and asphalt runways, aligned 01/19; 05/23; 09/27 and 13/31. In addition to the main airfield, seven axillary fields were constructed to support the training mission. Those were located as follows:\nThe locations of auxiliaries #3 (Roe), #4, #6 and #7 (Stuttgart) are undetermined.\n[270015#3] Stuttgart Airport - For the duration of the Cold War the runway and facilities were shared with the United States Army who operated helicopters, the Grumman OV-1 Mohawk and other fixed wing aircraft as Echterdingen Army Airfield on the southern portion of the airfield. Some of the units operating at Echterdingen were headquartered at nearby Nellingen Kaserne- now closed and redeveloped. In 1984-5, the 223rd Aviation Battalion (Combat) of the 11th Aviation Group (Combat) was headquartered at Echterdingen, with three aviation companies assigned (one at Schwäbisch Hall). The U.S. Army still maintains a small helicopter base - Stuttgart Army Airfield - on the southern side of the airport, which it shares with the Baden-Württemberg State Police helicopter wing. The police helicopter wing falls under the control of Stuttgart Police Department and has six modern helicopters based at Stuttgart and two in Söllingen.\n[22776054#2] Stuttgart Army Air Field (Arkansas) - The school and airfield was activated on 15 August 1942 and used by the Army Air Forces Training Command. Initially it was used as a glider pilot training school using Waco CG-4A gliders. In 1943 the airfield was transferred to Southeast Training Command as an advanced twin-engine flying school and glider training ceased on 19 May 1943. Initially designated as Army Air Forces Advanced Flying School, it was redesignated as Stuttgart Army Air Field on 2 January 1943. Stuttgart AAF primarily trained medium bomber and transport pilots using the Beechcraft AT-10 Wichita and Cessna AT-17 Bobcat, the host unit being the 34th Two Engine Flying Training Group and the 891st through 896th Two Engine Flying Training Squadrons. Aircraft assigned to Stuttgart AAF carried the fuselage code \"ST\". With a reorganization of Training Command's training unit designation system in the spring of 1944, the 34th and its squadrons were disbanded on 1 April 1944; the school being operated by the 2141st Army Air Force Base Unit, its training squadrons being re-designated \"A\" through \"F\" in sequence.\n[6016721#2] Pattonville - Also a part of Pattonville was the Stuttgart Golf Club, a 7,000 yard 18 hole golf course and club on 300 acres operated by and for the US military and their families. Designed by Bernhard von Limburger, it was opened in 1956. In 1969 Germans were allowed to golf on the course for the first time. Over time the club allowed a limited number of German members and the club was transitioned to shared German control with the large withdrawal of US Army personnel from Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg following the Gulf War. The Golf Club is now known as Golf Club Neckar eV. The American Stuttgart Golf Club is operated by the United States Army Garrison Stuttgart Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Office. The Golf Course and Club are the only remaining link to the former US installation.\n[28565#37] Stuttgart - Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few \"enduring communities\" where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly \"Purple\"—as in joint service—since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.\n[26420615#2] Almyra Municipal Airport - The airport was built by the United States Army Air Forces during 1942/43 as an axillary airfield for Stuttgart Army Airfield, near Stuttgart, Arkansas. It was known simply as Stuttgart Army Airfield Auxiliary #5. The runways in use today were built during that period. It was used to help train medium bomber and transport pilots, who used it for emergencies on it or practiced touch-and-go landings. It was not manned, and at the end of World War II it was simply abandoned and the land turned over to local authorities, like many other small auxiliary airfields.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When did Spain join the Euro zone?\n\nContexts: [2268889#45] Economic history of Spain - Spain joined the European Economic Community, as the European Union was then known, in January 1986 at the same time as neighbor Portugal. Membership ushered the country into opening its economy, modernizing its industrial base and revising economic legislation to open its previously protected markets to foreign competition. With help of EU funds (Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds, European Regional Development Fund, etc.) Spain greatly improved infrastructures, increased GDP growth, reduced the public debt to GDP ratio.\nSpain has been a driving force in the European community ever since. The country was a leading proponent of the EU single currency, the euro, long before it had been put into circulation. Together with the other founding euro members, it adopted the new physical currency on January 1, 2002. On that date Spain terminated its historic peseta currency and replaced it with the euro, which has become its national currency shared the rest of the Eurozone. This culminated a fast process of economic modernization even though the strength of the euro since its adoption has raised concerns regarding the fact that Spanish exports outside the European Union are being priced out of the range of foreign buyers, with the country losing monetary sovereignty in favour of the European Central Bank, which must look after several different -often opposed- national interests.\n[27393#54] Economy of Spain - Due to the lack of own resources, Spain has to import all of its fossil fuels. Besides, until the 2008 crisis, Spain's recent performance had shown an inflationary tendency and an inflationary gap compared to other EMU countries, affecting the country's overall productivity. Moreover, when Spain joined the euro zone, it lost the recourse of resorting to competitive devaluations, risking a permanent and cumulative loss of competitive due to inflation. In a scenario of record oil prices by the mid 2000s this meant much added pressure to the inflation rate. In June 2008 the inflation rate reached a 13-year high at 5.00%.\n[13299#149] History of Spain - In the wake of its joining the EEC, Spain experienced an economic boom during two decades, cut painfully short by the financial crisis of 2008.\nDuring the boom years, Spain attracted a large number of immigrants, especially from the United Kingdom, but also including unknown but substantial illegal immigration, mostly from Latin America, eastern Europe and north Africa.\nSpain had the fourth largest economy in the Eurozone, but after 2008 the global economic recession hit Spain hard, with the bursting of the housing bubble and unemployment reaching over 25%, sharp budget cutbacks were needed to stay in the Euro zone. The GDP shrank 1.2% in 2012. Although interest rates were historically low, investments were not encouraged sufficiently by entrepreneurs. Losses were especially high in real estate, banking, and construction. Economists concluded in early 2013 that, \"Where once Spain's problems were acute, now they are chronic: entrenched unemployment, a large mass of small and medium-sized enterprises with low productivity, and, above all, a constriction in credit.\"\nWith the financial crisis and high unemployment, Spain is now suffering from a combination of continued illegal immigration paired with a massive emigration of workers, forced to seek employment elsewhere under the EU's \"Freedom of Movement\", with an estimated 700,000, or 1.5% of total population, leaving the country between 2008 and 2013.\n[27393#6] Economy of Spain - Strong GDP growth was registered also in 2016, with the country growing twice as fast as the Euro zone average. In this regard, the Spanish economy is forecast to remain the best-performing major economy in the Euro zone also in 2017. Spain's unemployment rate heavily decreased from 2013 to 2017, although the real unemployment rate is much lower, as there is an estimation of millions of people working in the \"grey market\", people who count as unemployed or inactive but still perform jobs. The real Spanish GDP is as well about 20% bigger, as the underground economy moves annually 190.000 million euros (224.200 million USD). From any high income European country, just Italy and Greece have more underground economy than Spain has, so Spain has as well a bigger purchasing power and a smaller GINI coefficient.\n[54210#1] Greek euro coins - Greece did not enter the Eurozone until 2001 and was not able to start minting coins as early as the other eleven member states, so a number of coins circulated in 2002 were not minted in Athens but in Finland (€1 and €2 – mint mark \"S\"), France (1c, 2c, 5c, 10c and 50c – mint mark \"F\") and Spain (20c – mint mark \"E\"). The coins minted in Athens for the euro introduction in 2002, as well as all the subsequent Greek euro coins, carry only the Greek mint mark.\n[184391#4] Eurozone - In 1998, eleven member states of the European Union had met the euro convergence criteria, and the eurozone came into existence with the official launch of the euro (alongside national currencies) on 1 January 1999. Greece qualified in 2000, and was admitted on 1 January 2001 before physical notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002, replacing all national currencies. Between 2007 and 2015, seven new states acceded.\n[1046880#4] Slovak euro coins - On 3 June 2008 European Union finance ministers gave Slovakia the green light to join the euro zone in 2009 while urging the country to be ready to fight inflation with tight fiscal policies. \"We are happy to see Slovakia join the euro zone on January 1, 2009,\" Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, told reporters.\n[17563285#21] Euro starter kits - Spain was one of the first countries to join the eurozone. The Spanish starter kits or \"Monedero Euro\" had a face value of €12,02, equivalent to 1999.96 pesetas; however, they were sold for 2000 pesetas. These kits were released on 15 December 2001. On 1 September 2001, special starter kits for merchants were issued. The latter had a face value of €30,41 (5060 pesetas).\n[26152387#51] European debt crisis - Nevertheless, in June 2012, Spain became a prime concern for the Euro-zone when interest on Spain's 10-year bonds reached the 7% level and it faced difficulty in accessing bond markets. This led the Eurogroup on 9 June 2012 to grant Spain a financial support package of up to €100 billion. The funds will not go directly to Spanish banks, but be transferred to a government-owned Spanish fund responsible to conduct the needed bank recapitalisations (FROB), and thus it will be counted for as additional sovereign debt in Spain's national account. An economic forecast in June 2012 highlighted the need for the arranged bank recapitalisation support package, as the outlook promised a negative growth rate of 1.7%, unemployment rising to 25%, and a continued declining trend for housing prices. In September 2012 the ECB removed some of the pressure from Spain on financial markets, when it announced its \"unlimited bond-buying plan\", to be initiated if Spain would sign a new sovereign bailout package with EFSF/ESM. Strictly speaking, Spain was not hit by a sovereign debt-crisis in 2012, as the financial support package that they received from the ESM was earmarked for a bank recapitalization fund and did not include financial support for the government itself.\n[3200070#7] Hungary and the euro - When the countries of the eurozone adopted the Euro Plus Pact on 25 March 2011, Hungary decided to go along with the United Kingdom, Sweden and the Czech Republic and chose not to join the pact. Matolcsy said that they could agree with the most of its contents, but did not want to give up the country's independence regarding corporate tax matters. As the Euro Plus Pact does not feature any legal obligations - but only commitments to use various sets of voluntary tools to improve employment, competitiveness, fiscal responsibility and financial stability - joining this pact would not lead to a requirement for Hungary to abandon their current corporate tax method.\n[1046880#6] Slovak euro coins - On 17 June 2008, the European Parliament agreed to Slovakia's bid to join the euro zone from the start of 2009, urging the country to tighten fiscal policies to avoid inflationary risks. The assembly voted 589 to 17 with 86 abstentions to approve a report that said the European Union newcomer met all euro entry criteria. However, the parliament's role is consultative only. Slovakia's bid to become the euro zone's 16th member was approved by EU leaders. EU finance ministers set the final conversion rate of the Slovak koruna into the euro on 8 July 2008.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

During the 1918 influenza epidemic Stadie invented oxygen therapy for treatment of cyanosis, a condition resulting from pneumonia.\n[18490611#0] Diabetes (journal) - Diabetes is a monthly peer-reviewed medical journal published since 1952 by the American Diabetes Association. It covers research about the physiology and pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus including any aspect of laboratory, animal or human research. Emphasis is on investigative reports focusing on areas such as the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications, normal and pathologic pancreatic islet function and intermediary metabolism, pharmacological mechanisms of drug and hormone action, and biochemical and molecular aspects of normal and abnormal biological processes. Diabetes also publishes abstracts presented at the ADA's annual meeting, Scientific Sessions, in as a supplement.\n[2168708#4] American Diabetes Association - The ADA was founded in 1940 by six leading physicians − including Dr. Herman O. Mosenthal, Dr. Joseph T. Beardwood Jr., Dr. Joseph H. Barack, and Dr. E. S. Dillion − at their 1939 meeting of The American College of Physicians. In September 1946, they hosted a meeting in Toronto, Canada to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the discovery of insulin. The meeting served as a successful forum for hundreds of physicians and leading figures interested in the studies of diabetes and carbohydrate metabolism. The organization is now a national nonprofit with 40 affiliate organizations, more than 800 individual chapters, over a million volunteers, and almost 1,000 staff members − including officer and a board of directors.\n[21614504#1] American Association of Diabetes Educators - Founded in 1973, AADE works to define the practice of diabetes education, increase patients' access to the services of diabetes educators, and provide members with the support and tools to become leaders in the field of diabetes care.\n[24483381#2] Errol Morrison - He has carried out pioneering work in the medical field with a particular interest in diabetes. In 1982, he pioneered the formation of the Diabetes Association of the Caribbean, which now has 26 member countries, and was its President from 1985 to 1987 and its Vice President from 1989 to 1991. In 1991, he launched the University Diabetes Outreach Project (UDOP) with the help of a Wolfson Foundation grant. He played a key role in partnerships between the International Diabetes Federation and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), in responding to the emerging pandemic of type 2 diabetes, by applying the St. Vincent Declaration intervention model to the Americas, in the form of the Declaration of the Americas on Diabetes or DOTA (1996).\n[31428206#7] Robert Daniel Lawrence - In 1934, he conceived the idea of an association which would foster research and encourage education and welfare of patients. To this end a group of doctors and diabetics met in the London home of Lawrence's patient, H. G. Wells, the scientist and writer, and the Diabetic Association was formed. When other countries followed suit it became the British Diabetic Association (the BDA). Lawrence was Chairman of the Executive Council from 1934–1961 and Hon. Life President from 1962. His enthusiasm and drive ensured the life and steady growth of this association which soon became the voice of the diabetic population and constantly sought to promote the welfare of diabetics. There are now active branches through the country. He was also a prime mover in production of \"The Diabetic Journal\" (forerunner of Balance), the first issue of which appeared in January 1935. Many articles thereafter were contributed by himself anonymously. He and colleague Joseph Hoet were the main proponents in founding the International Diabetes Federation and he served as their first president from 1950–1958. At their triennial conferences, Lawrence's appearance was always greeted with acclaim.\n[11462785#6] Wendell Wise Mayes Jr. - Mayes became a volunteer working to improve the lives of people with diabetes when his son Wendell Mayes III was diagnosed with diabetes at age nine. He has served as Chairman of the American Diabetes Association (1974–77) and President of the International Diabetes Federation (1991–94), the first layperson to hold the position. The American Diabetes Association named its highest non-scientific award for Mayes and presented him with the first medal in 1986. The ADA also presented Mayes with the Charles H. Best Medal (1978), the Addison B. Scoville Award (1977), the Josiah Kirby Lilly Sr. Award (1991) and the Harold Rifkin Award (1994). In 1994 in Kobe, Japan, the Colloquium on Medical Science presented Mayes with the Masaji Takeda Medal. Mayes was honored by the American Diabetes Association Texas Affiliate in 1994 with a dinner in Dallas. When the State of Texas formed the Texas Diabetes Council in 1983, he served as its first chairman. For nine months in 1999 he returned to the Texas Diabetes Council to serve as its Interim Executive Director. He was the first inductee into the Texas Diabetes Hall of Fame.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Does XETV-TDT have a website?\n\nContexts: [1645718#0] XETV-TDT - XETV-TDT, virtual channel 6 (UHF digital channel 23), is a Mexican free-to-air television station located in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico, carrying the Canal 5 network. XETV's terrestrial signal also covers the San Diego, California area across the international border in the United States. The station is owned by Mexican media company Grupo Televisa, and its technical operations and transmitter facilities are located on Mount San Antonio in Tijuana.\n[1645718#20] XETV-TDT - In October 2001, Grupo Televisa entered into a joint sales and programming agreement with Entravision Communications. Under this agreement, Entravision, which already operated UPN affiliate XHUPN-TV (channel 49, now MyNetworkTV affiliate XHDTV-TDT) under a local marketing agreement, took over the management of XETV and consolidated XHUPN's operations into XETV's facilities. The agreement expired in 2006; by 2007, Televisa, through Bay City Television, had retaken full control of XETV's operations.\n[1645718#21] XETV-TDT - During a seminar by Sam Zell on 25 March 2008, it was announced that Tribune Broadcasting (which Zell had acquired the previous year as part of his takeover of corporate parent Tribune Company) had signed an affiliation agreement with Fox for its San Diego CW affiliate KSWB-TV (channel 69). Fox cited concerns with having its programming airing on a Mexican-licensed station, even though XETV had been with the network since Fox's inception and had broadcast its programming almost entirely in English for over half a century. This caught XETV station management off guard as officials were unaware about the pending affiliation switch until the announcement was made public.\n[1645718#39] XETV-TDT - XETV had originally carried a local newscast from the station's sign-on in 1953 until its news department was shut down in 1967 (Lionel Van Deerlin, later a congressman representing San Diego in the U.S. House of Representatives, served as news director during XETV's early years). In 1980, during its tenure as an independent station, XETV began running local news updates throughout the day; these continued to air until several months prior to the station's affiliation with Fox in October 1986. Although then-general manager Martin Colby originally stated that XETV would not offer a newscast, in response to then-Fox President Barry Diller's comments during the 1991 Television Critics Association Convention in pushing for Fox's affiliates to produce local newscasts that the network \"won't tolerate any affiliate that is not in the news business,\" XETV began reconsidering the possibility of launching a news department.\n[1645718#25] XETV-TDT - The announcement of The CW's move to KFMB left XETV's future in question, with a station spokesperson stating on the day of the announcement that the station was evaluating its options. The station would reveal its plans on 26 January; on that date, it announced that news programming on XETV would be discontinued following the conclusion of the 10:00 p.m. newscast on 31 March 2017. Then, at midnight on 31 May and at the network's request, the CW affiliation moved to KFMB-TV's 8.2 subchannel. KFMB-TV also purchased substantially all of XETV's syndicated program inventory to run on the new subchannel, which it branded as \"The CW San Diego\". XETV then moved Canal 5 programming from its 6.2 subchannel to its main 6.1 subchannel, making the station a full-time Spanish-language outlet for the first time in its history. XETV had initially indicated it would transmit the Gala TV network, already seen in the Tijuana/San Diego area on XHBJ-TDT (channel 45), but later retracted that statement.\n[1645718#35] XETV-TDT - Prior to the CW disaffiliation, syndicated programs broadcast by XETV () included \"Maury\", \"Seinfeld\", \"The Insider\", \"Rules of Engagement\", \"The Doctors\" and \"2 Broke Girls\". As the San Diego affiliate of The CW, XETV-TDT cleared the network's entire programming schedule on digital channel 6.1 until 30 May 2017, when some of these shows carried over to KFMB's \"The CW San Diego\" subchannel.\n[1645718#30] XETV-TDT - In 2000, XETV began transmitting a digital signal on UHF channel 23, becoming the first San Diego area station to begin digital television transmissions. It was also the first television station in Mexico to operate a digital signal; no other Mexican television station had begun digital operations at that time, and a digital television standard was not formally selected until 2004. It maps on digital tuners in both countries as virtual channel 6.1 through PSIP technology. In January 2006, the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation, which at the time still regulated broadcasting in Mexico, gave formal authorization for XETV's digital signal, with the full callsign XETV-TDT (a suffix standing for \"Televisión digital terrestre\", or Digital terrestrial television) and an effective radiated power of 402.8 kilowatts.\n[1645718#27] XETV-TDT - Because XETV-TDT is licensed to Tijuana by the Mexican government, it is not covered under the FCC's must carry rules. This means that local cable providers are not required to carry XETV-TDT, even if the television station requests to be carried under this provision. As an English-language station XETV had been carried by Cox Communications, Time Warner Cable (now Charter Spectrum) and AT&T U-verse in San Diego, all on channel 6. KFMB-TV's \"The CW San Diego\" has replaced XETV on the American cable systems, as well as satellite television providers DirecTV and Dish Network. XETV is carried by all Mexican cable systems in its coverage area, as carriage of local broadcast stations is mandated by the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT).\n[1645718#33] XETV-TDT - XETV retained virtual channel 6 after a major reshuffle of Mexican virtual channels in October 2016, which ordered all existing Mexican national networks to realign their virtual channels based on the flagship channel numbers in Mexico City. XETV then was temporarily the only station using a channel 6 assignment throughout Mexico, because the IFT reserved channel 6 for a potential fourth national network; as of February 2018, channel 6 has been assigned nationwide to Multimedios Televisión, which re-numbered all of their stations (including construction concessions that include the CDMX and Guadalajara regions) to that number (currently, Multimedios has no plans to expand their network to Tijuana, though its sister news network Milenio Television began an affiliation with XHDTV-TDT in September 2018). Virtual channel 5 is not available to XETV because of signal overlap between XETV and KTLA (owned by Tribune, and broadcasting on virtual channel 5), primarily around Oceanside, California; most Tijuana stations face similar signal overlap issues in this area to Los Angeles stations that preclude them from using the virtual channels that correspond to their networks.\n[1645718#26] XETV-TDT - Bay City Television, the Televisa subsidiary which operated XETV from San Diego, concurrently ceased operations on 31 May; unusually, the same repeat episode of \"The King of Queens\" that ended XETV's run as an English-language station near midnight local time, launched KFMB-DT2's run as a CW affiliate three minutes later. By Dunning's estimate, about 150 full-time, part-time, and freelance staffers were laid off between the closure of the news department on 31 March and the corporate shutdown. In addition to ending channel 6's affiliation with The CW three months earlier than scheduled, the closure of Bay City Television concluded XETV's 64-year history of serving San Diego with English-language programming; the move left MyNetworkTV affiliate XHDTV-TDT as the sole Mexican-licensed station providing English-language programming to the San Diego market.\n[1645718#31] XETV-TDT - As the original American digital television transition date of 17 February 2009 approached, XETV had expressed intentions to follow other San Diego-area stations in ceasing transmission of its analog signal. While the U.S. switchover deadline of 17 February was later pushed back to 12 June 2009 and only applied to American-licensed stations in any case, plans were announced to voluntarily make the station's English-language programming digital-only. The analog signal would be repurposed to retransmit the Mexican Galavisión network (not to be confused with the American cable channel of the same name). Claims on XETV's website that the station was indeed going to transmit a digitally-exclusive signal were rescinded on 17 February 2009 as the station decided to delay cutting off its analog signal until after it secured approval from the Mexican government. XETV management later stated that it had decided to maintain its analog signal to benefit Mexican viewers. XETV's analog signal was eventually repurposed on 5 March 2012, when the station began multicasting on its digital signal with the addition of Televisa's youth-oriented Canal 5 network on subchannel 6.2 and on its analog feed, while digital channel 6.1 retained the newscasts, CW network and syndicated programs in English. On the same date, XHBJ-TV channel 45 dropped Canal 5 for Galavisión. Canal 5 replaced XETV's English-language programming on its analog signal, in order to serve Spanish-speaking viewers in Tijuana that did not have television sets with built-in digital tuners or digital converter boxes prior to the Tijuana market's 2013 transition to digital television. The affiliation switch coincided with the commencement of digital multicasting on Televisa's Tijuana stations. Canal 5 moved to its primary channel on 31 May 2017, at which point, the 6.2 subchannel was decommissioned.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When did Dreamfall Chapters come out?\n\nContexts: [727748#28] Dreamfall: The Longest Journey - On 1 March 2007, Funcom announced that the continuation of the story will be published under the title \"Dreamfall Chapters\". The numerous cliffhangers and apparent plot holes in \"Dreamfall\" have caused a great commotion among the players and were addressed by Ragnar Tørnquist on his blog. He stated that the game is, in fact, the first part of a duology and that all questions will be answered in the second installment. In November 2012, Ragnar Tørnquist's newly founded studio Red Thread Games began the pre-production of the sequel. Because Funcom's focus has shifted to online games, the company decided to license the rights to \"The Longest Journey\" IP to Tørnquist's development studio, who will fund and produce the game independently. A Kickstarter campaign to crowd-fund the game began in February 2013 and ended successfully raising $1.5 million in March. Tørnquist commented that the developers also considered the idea of making a film based on \"The Longest Journey\" or \"Dreamfall\" but found it too difficult to realize at the current stage.\n[9796250#32] Dreamfall Chapters - \"Dreamfall Chapters\" was initially announced as an episodic video game, but this idea was scrapped in favor of a full-length game when the pre-production started in 2012, because the developers felt that extended breaks between chapters would have negatively affected the story flow and pacing. However, faced with mounting production costs, RTG decided in June 2014 to return to the episodic format, and the first \"book\", subtitled \"Reborn\", was released on 21 October 2014. The subtitle of Book Two was announced on 26 November 2014. The subtitle of Book Three was announced on 22 May 2015, and its release date, one month later. Book Four's subtitle was announced via Twitter and Facebook in late September, and its release date, on 30 November 2015. The subtitle and the release date of the fifth and final Book was announced via Kickstarter on 6 April and 9 June 2016, respectively.\n[727748#0] Dreamfall: The Longest Journey - Dreamfall: The Longest Journey () is an adventure video game developed by Funcom for Microsoft Windows and Xbox platforms in April 2006. On 1 March 2007, a sequel entitled \"Dreamfall Chapters\" was announced, and Funcom reportedly considered the idea of a massively multiplayer online game set in \"The Longest Journey\" universe.\n[9796250#3] Dreamfall Chapters - \"Dreamfall Chapters\" was originally developed on the Unity 4 game engine, but was retroactively upgraded to Unity 5 before the release of Book Four. It features large 3D environments, as opposed to 2D backgrounds in \"The Longest Journey\" and smaller 3D locations in \"Dreamfall\". While not a completely open world, the game contains several free-roaming exploration levels, such as Europolis and Marcuria, and rewards players for exploring the levels and finding secrets. The locations themselves change slightly as the story progresses to reflect the passage of time.\nThe player steers playable characters from over-the-shoulder third-person view, using the WASD keys and mouselook. Interactive characters and objects are highlighted on the screen, allowing the player to interact with them using the mouse and context menus. While the game supports game controllers, it was optimized for the PC. The gameplay focus is on the exploration of the environments and the story and on solving puzzles. Dialogue with NPCs and dialogue puzzles comprise about half of the gameplay time. The on-screen interface is hidden by default to improve the immersion. There is no combat or stealth gameplay in \"Dreamfall Chapters\".\n[9796250#31] Dreamfall Chapters - The game was originally written in English, with the Norwegian, German, and French translations confirmed, although (version 5.7.4.4), the Steam version only contains English and German voice-overs and English, German, and French subtitles. \"Dreamfall Chapters\" was translated into German by the Vienna-based studio White Rabbit Interactive, and into French, by the Parisian Words of Magic; German voice-overs were recorded by the Hamburg-based Studio Mühl. The German voice-overs for Book Three were released six weeks after the English release, partly because each episode contains 25 to 50 thousand spoken words, and partly because the developers did not lock down the dialogue until several weeks before the release. Initially, CDP.pl had plans to release the Polish translation, but dropped it after the game returned to the episodic format.\n[9796250#17] Dreamfall Chapters - On 1 November 2012, it was announced that Ragnar Tørnquist's newly founded studio Red Thread Games began the pre-production for \"Dreamfall Chapters\". Because Funcom's focus has shifted to online games, the company decided to license the rights to \"The Longest Journey\" IP to Tørnquist's development studio, who would fund and produce the game independently. Although Tørnquist stated he took no other Funcom employees to Red Thread Games with him, his studio hired many of the original developers of \"Dreamfall\" who have since left Funcom, as well as formed a partnership with Blink Studios, which consists of former Funcom employees who worked on \"Dreamfall\" and have since developed an expertise with the \"Unity\" engine.\n[9796250#1] Dreamfall Chapters - \"The Longest Journey\" series is set in two parallel universes: Stark, a cyberpunk future Earth, and Arcadia, its magical fantasy counterpart. \"Chapters\" takes place in 2220 CE and continues the story of \"Dreamfall\", whose protagonist Zoë Castillo had uncovered a criminal conspiracy that aimed to enslave both Stark and Arcadia by stealing their residents' dreams. Although Zoë managed to disrupt the conspirators' plans, she was betrayed and left in a coma at the end of \"Dreamfall\", and has to find her purpose in life again in \"Chapters\". The writers described the narrative theme of the game as \"chapters of life\".\n[9796250#19] Dreamfall Chapters - A campaign to crowd-fund the game on Kickstarter began on 8 February 2013, with a minimal goal of $850,000. Although game's intended full title has always been \"Dreamfall Chapters\", the developers had used the subtitle \"The Longest Journey\" during the Kickstarter campaign to improve brand recognition. They estimated the necessary budget for the project to be about $1 million (compared to the $5 million budget of \"Dreamfall\" and roughly $2–3 million of \"TLJ\") and planned to supplement the Kickstarter money with further grants and personal funds. Prior to starting the campaign, RTG spent months analyzing previous successful Kickstarter campaigns, particularly \"Project Eternity\" and \"\", to better plan their own project. \"Dreamfall Сhapters\" reached its minimal funding goal on 16 February, much quicker than the developers had anticipated, and concluded on 10 March with $1,538,425 raised, or 180% of the initial goal. Additionally, over $34,000 was raised via PayPal during the Kickstarter campaign, and Red Thread Games continued to collect funds through PayPal until 10 October 2014, when pre-orders for the game were opened.\n[9796250#16] Dreamfall Chapters - Funcom, the developer of the original \"The Longest Journey\" and \"Dreamfall\", first announced \"Dreamfall Chapters\" on 1 March 2007. However, while its plot was already written out at that point, the production of the game couldn't begin until 2012 because all of the original creators of \"Dreamfall\" (including Tørnquist) were at the time working on Funcom's next MMORPG \"The Secret World\".\n[9796250#0] Dreamfall Chapters - Dreamfall Chapters () is an episodic 3D adventure game with emphasis on character interaction, exploration of the game world, and puzzle solving. It is a sequel to the adventure games \"The Longest Journey\" and \"\". The game was released for PC in five episodes between 21 October 2014 and 17 June 2016. The updated \"Final Cut\" version was released on physical media for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 5 May 2017, and the Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux versions on 21 July 2017.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

The Clan Campbell's first involvement was an attack in 1647, and Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll finally captured the Castle in 1691. The Castle was then demolished, leaving the Castle in ruin. Large bricks from the ruins of the Castle were used by Donald Maclean, 5th Laird of Torloisk, to build a cottage for his family close to the Castle. By 1751, the castle has been abandoned and was officially part of the Torosay Castle estate. \nDescendants of Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll sold the castle in 1801. It was purchased by Clan MacQuarrie, before it was sold to Carter-Campbell of Possil, who kept the Castle as a ruin in the Torosay estate. When the estate was sold, the Castle ruin was purchased by Sir Fitzroy Donald Maclean and restored.\n[38410920#6] Sir Lachlan Mackinnon (clan chief) - In 1609, Lachlan was also one of twelve leading men of the Highlands who submitted formally to the Bishop of the Isles (Andrew Knox) in Iona and (in August) entered into a bond to observe the Statutes of Icolmkill, a regulatory reform which Donald Gregory described as “of the utmost importance for the improvement of the Isles”. His eleven co-signatories were Angus Macdonald of Dunnyveg, Hector Og Maclean of Duart, Donald Gorm Macdonald of Sleat, Ruari Macleod of Harris, Donald Macdonald (the Captain of Clanranald), Lachlan Maclean of Coll, Hector Maclaine of Lochbuie, Lachlan and Allan Maclean (the brothers of Duart), Gillespie MacQuarrie of Ulva and Donald Macfie of Colonsay.\n[704690#0] Donald Maclean (spy) - Donald Duart Maclean (; 25 May 1913 – 6 March 1983) was a British diplomat and member of the Cambridge Five, who acted as spies for the Soviet Union.\n[1939941#0] Yuri Modin - Yuri Modin (November 8, 1922 in Suzdal – 2007 in Moscow) was the KGB controller for the \"Cambridge Five\" from 1948 to 1951, during which Donald Duart Maclean was said to have passed atomic secrets to the Soviets. In 1951, Modin arranged the defections of Maclean and Guy Burgess. Modin's predecessors in control of the damaging Cambridge spy ring were executed during Stalin's Great Purge.\n[704690#7] Donald Maclean (spy) - From Gresham's, Maclean won a place at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, arriving in 1931 to read modern languages. Even before the end of his first year he began to throw off parental restraints and engage openly in communist agitprop. He also played rugby for his college through the winter of 1932–33. Eventually his ambitions would lead to him joining the Communist Party. In his second year at Cambridge, his father died, afterwards marking a period of parental relaxation. Maclean's political views grew much more apparent in the following years in light of \"his admiring, if sometimes puzzled, mother\".\n[460457#6] Donald Maclean (British politician) - Maclean married Gwendolen Margaret Devitt (26 September 1880 – 23 July 1962), daughter of Andrew Devitt (1850–1931) and Jane Dales Morrison (1856–1947), on 2 October 1907. They are buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Penn, Buckinghamshire, together with their eldest son, Ian. The diplomat and spy, Donald Duart Maclean, was another of his sons.\n[21808277#0] Sir John Maclean, 4th Baronet - Sir John Maclean, 4th Baronet of Duart and Morvern (1670–1716) was the 20th Clan Chief of Clan Maclean from 1674 to 1716. He was the 16th and last Laird of Duart, when in 1691 he lost Castle Duart to Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll. The castle wasn't recovered by Clan Maclean until 1912 until it was purchased by Fitzroy Donald Maclean, 221 years later.\n[14093807#6] Counterintelligence failures - A group of Soviet sympathizers, in respected positions in British society, formed the Cambridge Five, sometimes called the Cambridge Four, and it has never been established how many active agents were involved. Of these, the most devastating was Kim Philby. Other confirmed members included Donald Duart Maclean, Guy Burgess, and Anthony Blunt. See Cambridge Five for other suspects.\n[704690#37] Donald Maclean (spy) - The three Maclean children all married Russians, but left Moscow to live in London and the U.S, as they still had the right to British or American passports. Fergus, the eldest son, enrolled at University College London in 1974, prompting a question in Parliament. Donald's son, Donald, married firstly Lucy, daughter of George Hanna, an English man who worked for the BBC and friend of the family. They had a son, Donald Duart Maclean's only grandson (who was born in 1970), who resides in the UK.\n[1260465#2] Alan Nunn May - Nunn May joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in the 1930s, and was active in the Association of Scientific Workers. Cambridge Five spy ring member Donald Duart Maclean was also at Trinity Hall during an overlapping period.\n[704690#3] Donald Maclean (spy) - Born in Marylebone, London, Donald Duart Maclean was the son of Sir Donald Maclean and Gwendolen Margaret Devitt. His father was chosen as chairman of the rump of the 23 independent MPs who backed H. H. Asquith in the Liberal Party in the House of Commons whilst the bulk of the Liberal MPs had followed David Lloyd George into the Coalition Liberal party in the November 1918 election. As the Labour Party had no leader and Sinn Féin did not attend, he became titular Leader of the Opposition. Maclean's parents had houses in London (later in Buckinghamshire) as well as in the Scottish Borders, where his father represented Peebles and Southern Midlothian, but the family lived mostly in and around London. He grew up in a very political household, in which world affairs were constantly discussed. In 1931 his father entered the Coalition Cabinet as President of the Board of Education.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What happens if the Speaker of the House dies?\n\nContexts: [46023#5] Speaker of the United States House of Representatives - To be elected speaker a candidate must receive an absolute majority of the votes cast, as opposed to an absolute majority of the full membership of the Housepresently 218 votes, in a House of 435. There have only been a few instances during the past century where a person received a majority of the votes cast, and thus won the election, while failing to obtain a majority of the full membership. It happened most recently in 2015 (114th Congress), when John Boehner was elected with 216 votes (as opposed to 218). Such a variation in the number of votes necessary to win a given election might arise due to vacancies, absentees, or members being present but not voting. If no candidate wins a majority of the \"votes cast for a person by name,\" then the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. Multiple roll calls have been necessary only 14 times (out of 125 speakership elections) since 1789; and not since 1923 (68th Congress), when a closely divided House needed nine ballots to elect Frederick H. Gillett speaker. Upon winning election the new Speaker is immediately sworn in by the Dean of the United States House of Representatives, the chamber's longest-serving member.\n[52887123#0] List of Speaker of the United States House of Representatives elections - This is a list of elections for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Elections for Speaker are typically held shortly after the new Congress assembles. If a Speaker dies or resigns, a special election may be held.\n[5879951#84] Legislative violence - The day after the incident, House Speaker Tip O'Neill condemned the behavior, and said he told Dornan, \"You can settle it on the street, but don't settle it on the House floor.\" He also told reporters that \"discipline\" would ensue if \"anything like that\" happened again. That day, Downey stated again, \"Congressman Dornan owes me and the House of Representatives an apology.\" Dornan responded, \"Apologize for what? For calling him a wimp? I am willing to concede that perhaps he just walks, talks and acts like a little arrogant wimp. But maybe it's disinformation. Maybe he really wears a black leather jacket by night that I don't know about.\"\n[48122208#5] October 2015 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election - The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is the presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives. The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress (i.e. , after a general election) or when a speaker dies, resigns or is removed from the position intra-term. Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote. Traditionally, each party's caucus or conference selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. Representatives are not restricted to voting for the candidate nominated by their party, but generally do, as the outcome of the election effectively determines which party has the majority and consequently will organize the House. Representatives that choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominated candidate usually vote for someone else in their party or vote \"present\".\n[13718381#2] Angel Viera Martínez - As a result of the 1980 elections, the New Progressive Party had won 26 seats and the Popular Democratic Party 25, but the latter challenged the results of the 35th Representative District, creating a tie with each party holding 25 seats, pending the final results of that district. Since the new House in 1981 was tied, it was unable to elect a Speaker, as required, by an absolute majority. To complicate matters, Ramón Muñiz (PPD 32nd District) died on the House Floor in January 1981 and Representative-elect Fernando Tonos Florenzán's election was invalidated due to him not having the constitutionally required 25 years to serve in the House, leaving the House with 25 New Progressives and 23 Popular Democrats. House Secretary Cristino Bernazard, who normally would have presided over the House only until it elected its new Speaker in its inaugural session, became the first unelected Acting Speaker of the House. During Bernazard's incumbency, he appointed co-chairs to the House standing committees and required that all House decisions and legislation be approved by consensus. After some political wrangling, in what became known as the Viera-Colberg Pact, the House elected Viera Martinez once again as Speaker for the remainder of 1981 and maverick Popular Democratic Rep. Severo Colberg Ramírez as Speaker from 1982 until 1984. In late 1981, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Popular Democratic candidate in the 35th District, and with the Popular Democrats finally filling in the two vacancies they had, that party gained control of the House, with a majority of 26. In 1982, Viera Martínez once again became the House Minority Leader.\n[46023#32] Speaker of the United States House of Representatives - Ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, with its mechanism for filling an intra-term vice presidential vacancy, has made calling on the speaker, president pro tempore, or a cabinet member to serve as acting president unlikely to happen, except in the aftermath of a catastrophic event. However, only a few years after it went into effect, in October 1973, at the height of Watergate, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. With Agnew's unexpected departure, and the state of Richard Nixon's presidency, Speaker of the House Carl Albert was suddenly first in line to become acting president. The vacancy continued until Gerald Ford was sworn in as vice president on December 6, 1973. Albert was also next in line from the time Ford assumed the presidency on August 9, 1974, following Nixon's resignation from office, until Ford's choice to succeed him as vice president, Nelson Rockefeller, was confirmed by Congress four months later.\n[3405117#15] Charles Wolfran Cornwall - Cornwall was the first Speaker of the House of Commons to die in office. He sat in the Speaker's chair for the last time on 29 December 1788, before falling ill with a \"feverish cold.\" He remained absent from the House for two days, but expected to return soon. On 2 January 1789 the \"Commons Journal\" records that \"the Clerk at the Table acquainted the House that we was extremely sorry to inform them that Mr Speaker died this morning.\" An autopsy was carried out where \"a large quantity of cold water was found in his stomach; and one of his collar bones turning with a sharp point to his lungs, had formed an abscess and occasioned his death.\"\n[3742610#3] Speaker of the House of Keys - Before the House was first elected in 1867 the role of Speaker was assumed to be for life. Thus when Edward Moore Gawne resigned in 1867, he was the first Speaker not to die in office. Since then, although it is possible to resign the office, or nowadays even to fail to be re-elected, all Speakers died in office until Sir Charles Kerruish in 1990, with the exception of John Robert Kerruish, who was elected to the Legislative Council in 1919. Since then none have died in office.\n[728093#36] Nick Clegg - The resignations happened not long after Michael Martin, the Speaker of the House of Commons, had on 26 February 2008 blocked calls by the Liberal Democrats for an \"in or out\" referendum on Britain's EU membership. The Speaker's authority was called into question when, led by Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrats marched out of the House of Commons, calling the Speaker's decision a constitutional \"outrage\". Just moments earlier, frontbench foreign affairs spokesman for the party Ed Davey had been expelled from the chamber by the Speaker's deputy, Sir Michael Lord, for further challenging the ruling.\n[46023#3] Speaker of the United States House of Representatives - The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress (i.e. , after a general election) or when a speaker dies, resigns or is removed from the position intra-term. Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote.

Representatives are not restricted to voting for the candidate nominated by their party, but generally do, as the outcome of the election effectively determines which party has the majority and consequently will organize the House. Moreover, as the Constitution does not explicitly state that the speaker must be an incumbent member of the House, it is permissible for representatives to vote for someone who is not a member of the House at the time, and non-members have received a few votes in various speaker elections over the past several years. Nevertheless, every person elected speaker has been a member.\n[57104071#3] 2019 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election - The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is the presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives. The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress (i.e. , after a general election) or when a speaker dies, resigns or is removed from the position intra-term.

It is the only living species in the genus Dermochelys and family Dermochelyidae. It can easily be differentiated from other modern sea turtles by its lack of a bony shell, hence the name. Instead, its carapace is covered by skin and oily flesh. \"Dermochelys\" is the only extant genus of the family Dermochelyidae.\n[12170337#6] New Guinea giant softshell turtle - \"P. bibroni\" is the among the largest species of freshwater turtle, surpassed or matched only by other species of \"Pelochelys\", as well as certain \"Chitra\", \"Rafetus\", and \"Macrochelys\" species. \"P. bibroni \" can reach up to in straight carapace length, and in weight.\n[10946605#12] Wildlife of Benin - Nile crocodiles \"(Crocodylus niloticus)\" the largest living reptile seen in river banks and ponds in the two protected parks, the dwarf caiman, smaller and docile species of chameleons in 100 colour variations. \nTortoises are: leopard tortoise \"(Stigmochelys pardalis)\", several species of terrapin and turtles – out of eight species of marine turtles four are found in Benin coast, namely, the green sea turtle \"(Chelonia mydas)\", olive ridley sea turtle \"(Lepidochelys olivacea)\" and leatherback sea turtle (\"Dermochelys coriacea\").

The broad-shelled river turtle is one of the oldest maturing and longest living species of freshwater turtles in existence and occurs in wide sympatry with \"Emydura macquarii\" and \"Chelodina longicollis\". \"C. expansa\" is listed as ‘vulnerable’ in South Australia and ‘threatened’ in Victoria.\n[8364073#1] Yangtze giant softshell turtle - The Yangtze giant softshell turtle is noted for its deep head with a pig-like snout and dorsally placed eyes. This critically endangered species holds the title of being the largest freshwater turtle in the world. Although hard to compare due to the extremely small number of remaining specimens, its average and maximum sizes seem to exceed other large freshwater turtles such as alligator snapping turtles and related giant softshells such as other \"Rafetus\" and \"Pelochelys\" species. It measures over in overall length and to in width, and can easily weigh up to . The average size of large turtle specimens (i.e. turtles weighing over ) that could be collected in the Yangtze River per one study was , although not all specimens were definitively identified as \"Rafetus\".

Its head can measure over in length and in width. The male is generally smaller than the female and has a longer, larger tail.\n[5630919#0] Spiny softshell turtle - The spiny softshell turtle (\"Apalone spinifera\") is a species of softshell turtle, one of the largest freshwater turtle species in North America. Both the common name, spiny softshell, and the specific name, \"spinifera\" (spine-bearing), refer to the spiny, cone-like projections on the leading edge of the carapace, which are not scutes (scales).\n[2075493#0] Arrau turtle - The Arrau turtle (\"Podocnemis expansa\"), also known as the South American river turtle, giant South American turtle, giant Amazon River turtle, Arrau sideneck turtle or simply the Arrau, is the largest of the side-neck turtles (Pleurodira) and the largest freshwater turtle in Latin America. The species primarily feeds on plant material and typically nests in large groups on beaches. Due to hunting of adults, collecting of their eggs, pollution, habitat loss, and dams, the Arrau turtle is seriously threatened.\n[9636749#43] Wildlife of Alaska - The Leatherback Sea Turtles often inhabit open waters but are still sometimes seen on coastal waters because of their title of the most migratory sea turtle species. The Leatherback Sea Turtle is the largest turtle in the world, weighing up to two thousand pounds and reaching up to six and a half feet by their adult years. The shell of the Leatherback Turtle, also called a carapace, can develop to one and a half inches and is the only shell on a sea turtle that is not hard and boney but rather soft and leather like to the touch.

It was built in 1955, and spans the Kanawha River, carrying West Virginia Route 34. The cantilever through-truss consists of two anchor spans each 245 feet in length and the main span 462 feet in length between pier center lines. The main span consists of two 128 feet, 4 inch, cantilever arms and a 205 feet, 4 inch, suspended span.\n[58446362#10] MV Eider - In 1924, \"Eider\" supported the first aerial circumnavigation of the world, achieved by United States Army Air Service aviators in four Douglas World Cruiser airplanes who took off from the naval air station at Sand Point in Seattle on 6 April 1924 and proceeded westward. The Soviet Union had prohibited the aircraft from landing on its soil, necessitating stops in the Territory of Alaska and Bering Sea area as the aircraft bypassed Soviet territory. \"Eider\" transported the advance personnel, supplies, gasoline, and lubricating oil needed to support the early stages of the trip to several locations in Alaska and the Bering Sea and provided the pilots with accommodations, meals, meteorological information, and moorings for the planes. Ultimately, two of the original airplanes completed the trip successfully by arriving at Seattle on 28 September 1924, 175 days after departing Naval Air Station Sand Point.\n[6779060#5] DELAG - In September 1928, DELAG began operating the successful rigid airship LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, which made regular, nonstop, transatlantic flights possible before airplanes had flight ranges sufficient to cross the ocean in either direction without stopping. For DELAG's first transatlantic trip, Dr. Eckener commanded the \"Graf Zeppelin\" airship leaving Friedrichshafen, Germany, at 07:54 on 11 October 1928, arriving at Lakehurst Field, New Jersey, on 15 October. In 1931 the airship Graf Zeppelin began offering regular scheduled passenger service between Germany and South America which continued until 1937. During its career Graf Zeppelin crossed the South Atlantic 136 times. In 1936, the airship \"Hindenburg\" entered passenger service and successfully crossed the Atlantic 36 times before catching fire at Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937.\n[2719004#9] Dieter Dengler - On February 1, 1966, the day after the carrier began flying missions from Yankee Station, Lieutenant, Junior Grade Dengler launched from the \"Ranger\" with three other aircraft on an interdiction mission against a truck convoy that had been reported in North Vietnam. Thunderstorms forced the pilots to divert to their secondary target, a road intersection located west of the Mu Gia Pass in Laos. At the time, U.S. air operations in Laos were classified \"secret\". Visibility was poor due to smoke from burning fields, and upon rolling in on the target, LTJG Dengler and the remainder of his flight lost sight of one another. Visibility was poor, and as Dengler rolled his Skyraider in on the target after flying for two-and-a-half hours into enemy territory, he was hit by anti-aircraft fire.\n[612609#5] De Havilland Dragon Rapide - On 17 April 1934, the prototype conducted its maiden flight at Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire. Flown by senior de Havilland test pilot H.S. Broad, it was powered by a pair of 200 hp Gypsy Six engines. Even prior to the prototype's first flight, plans to proceed with serial production of DH.89 had already received the go-ahead from management. During May 1934, airworthiness trials commenced at RAF Martlesham Heath using the prototype; during one such flight, upon attaining a speed of roughly 175 MPH, the tip of the aircraft's nose buckled. In response to this event, a maximum permissible speed of 160 MPH was implemented for all DH89. Upon the conclusion of trials, the prototype was sold.\n[1586884#1] D.Gray-man - A spin-off novel series, \"D.Gray-man Reverse\" by Kaya Kizaki, explores the history of a number of characters.

In 1875, he exhibited a large painting, some fourteen feet in length, depicting ‘Lord Wolverton's Bloodhounds’ - this was highly praised in Whyte-Melville's ‘Riding Recollections.’ Followed this in 1876 was ‘Colt-hunting in the New Forest’, in 1877 ‘The Fall of Man’ from Milton's ‘Paradise Lost’ and in 1879 ‘The Struggle for Existence’, now in the Walker Fine Art Gallery in Liverpool. In 1881 ‘Rescued’, in 1883 ‘Love and War: in the Abbotsbury Swannery’ and in 1885 ‘Cowed’. ‘The Fall of Man’, depicting a scene from Milton's 'Paradise Lost,' was widely praised and singled out by the Royal Academy for its portrayal of \"\"the savagery of the brute nature ensuing upon the disobedience of Adam and Eve\"\".\n[12026783#6] Dieudonné Costes - On 1–2 September 1930, Costes with Maurice Bellonte, flew the \"\"Point d'Interrogation\"\" from Paris to New York, as the first heavier-than-air aircraft to reach New York in the more difficult westbound direction between the North American and European mainlands. They covered either 5,850 km (3,633 miles) or 6,200 km (3,850 miles), according to different sources, in 37 hours 18 minutes. While flying over Portsmouth, New Hampshire, they lost their navigational map out of an open window of the plane. Two children saw the map falling from the sky while they were watching for the flight to cross over their farm. The children, Louise Stef and her brother John, returned the map to Costes, who had asked for its return through the media.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

His father, Mike Pratt, was an actor, songwriter and screenwriter but died when Guy was 14. He worked for a while as a graphic designer, but then decided to concentrate on a music career.In the late 1970's guy was in a band based in southend on sea called 'speedball', who released one 45 on NO PAP1 records called ' no survivors' - absolutely superb for its time within the mod revival of that period, the single today can fetch upwards of £200-£300 in mint condition. In 1981, aged 19, Pratt was asked to tour with Icehouse. Two years later as a member of Icehouse he supported David Bowie on his Serious Moonlight Tour, which was Bowie's longest, largest, and most successful concert tour.

The Scots College operated in Bathurst until 1945 when it moved back to Sydney. However many boys from central New South Wales were enrolled in the school and their parents asked the Trustees of the Presbyterian Church of Australia in New South Wales to continue the school at Bathurst. Consequently, the Trustees bought \"Karralee\" and established the Scots School, Bathurst.\n[8784076#3] Roman Catholic Diocese of Bathurst in Australia - According to Roman Catholic Church records, the first Mass to be celebrated near Bathurst, was by Father Therry in early November 1830, when he was called from Sydney to attend the execution of a convict. In July 1838, the Reverend Fathers Michael O'Reilly and Thomas Slattery arrived from Ireland and were appointed to Bathurst, now established as a new church district and covered an area of 26 stations from Mt Victoria, Mudgee, Bathurst, through to Wellington and Dubbo. In June 1841, Dean O'Reilly visited Wellington and Dubbo, the first recorded visit of a priest to these districts. The area of the Bathurst mission was broken down in size as new mission centres opened. Hartley/Lithgow was already recognised as a mission centre as far back as 1842; Carcoar (1847), Sofala (1851), Mudgee (1852), Wellington (1856) and Orange (1864).\n[323764#17] Bathurst, New South Wales - On 7 May 1815, Governor Macquarie at the terminus of Cox's Road raised the flag, ordered a ceremonial volley to be fired and proclaimed and named the future town of Bathurst after the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst. Bathurst is the oldest inland town in Australia. It was intended to be the administrative centre of the western plains of New South Wales, where orderly colonial settlement was planned.\n[8784076#0] Roman Catholic Diocese of Bathurst in Australia - The Roman Catholic Diocese of Bathurst (in Australia) is a Latin Church suffragan diocese of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Sydney, established in 1865, covering the Central West and Orana regions of New South Wales, Australia.\n[7544330#27] Bathurst railway station, New South Wales - Bathurst Railway Precinct is of state significance as a major country railway precinct in NSW that contains a substantial first-class station building, residence and important workshop group with a range of related railway structures. The 1876 station building is a unique Victorian Tudor style railway building and is a fine example of a first-class railway station building with original fabric and fine detailing typical of the period. The scale and detailing of the building reflects the importance of Bathurst as the largest city west of the Blue Mountains. The station is located at the end of Keppel St, one of the main streets of Bathurst and the buildings form a significant civic group in the town of Bathurst, particularly with the location of the residences and Engineer's Office in Havannah St and the orientation of the station building to the town. The station has rarity significance as the design of Bathurst station building is unique to any other building on the NSW rail system. The site is also significant for its association with Ben Chifley, former Prime Minister of Australia, whose early career and education at Bathurst Railway Precinct were instrumental in shaping his trade union and Labor politics.\n[8784076#5] Roman Catholic Diocese of Bathurst in Australia - 1865 saw Bathurst become a separate Diocese with the appointment of Dr Matthew Quinn was the first Bishop. The area covered by the Diocese changed little from when it was a mission in 1841, which extended from the River Murray to Queensland, and from the Blue Mountains to the border of South Australia, except that in on 10 May 1887 it lost territory to establish the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilcannia, to which more territory was lost in 1917, when it was renamed Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilcannia-Forbes.\n[57640003#64] Llanarth (house) - Bathurst Council listed the property as a heritage item on their local environment plan in March 1987. In July 1993 the National Trust of Australia listed the property on their heritage register. In mid 1995 Bathurst City Council received an application for a two lot subdivision and erection of two\nresidential dwellings on the land west of \"Llanarth\". It appears that this application was approved by Bathurst City Council and the Heritage Council and dwellings were built on the land west of \"Llanarth\" a short time later.\n[57647652#0] Old Bathurst Hospital - The Old Bathurst Hospital is a heritage-listed hospital building at Howick Street, Bathurst, Bathurst Region, New South Wales, Australia. Formerly the main building of the Bathurst Hospital, it was conserved and restored when a new hospital was built on the same site in 2006-2008, and is now used as consulting suites and an education centre for the new hospital. The building was designed by William Boles and built from 1880 to 1886 by J Willet. It was also known as Bathurst District Hospital or Bathurst Base Hospital before the redevelopment. The property is owned by the NSW Department of Health. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n[11289200#0] St Stanislaus' College (Bathurst) - St Stanislaus' College is a Catholic day and boarding high school for boys, founded in 1867 and conducted since 1889 by the Congregation of the Mission's priests and brothers. It is located in , New South Wales, Australia, a regional centre west of Sydney. The college is the oldest Catholic boys' boarding school in Australia, and currently caters for approximately 600 students from Years 7 to 12, including about 120 boarders. The early history of the College is intertwined with that of the short-lived St Charles' Seminary; both institutions shared the original towered section of building facing Brilliant Street until the latter closed in the late 1800s.\n[37119289#0] History of infrastructure development in Bathurst - In 2013 Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia celebrates 200 years from its naming as a town in 1813. Over the 200 years significant milestones have occurred in the town and regions infrastructure development to support growth of the region.\nThe development of Australia progressed with a few frontier towns built in extreme isolation like Bathurst. Sydney was founded in 1788 and 25 years later in 1813 only a few other coastal towns had been established. The desire to explore the unknown areas led the Colonial Government to sponsor expeditions to the interior of the vast country. A large mountain range running parallel to the Sydney coast blocked access to the west and rugged mountains and a river blocked access to the north. Before the exploration of the inland started they had no idea what they would find but what they did discover was fertile and well watered land ideal for grazing of animals and producing agricultural products.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Does hemp contain THC?\n\nContexts: [6262848#1] Cannabis flower essential oil - A pale yellow liquid, cannabis flower essential oil is a volatile oil that is a mixture of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other terpenoid compounds. The typical scent of hemp results from about 140 different terpenoids. The essential oil is manufactured from both low-THC (\"fibre-type\") and high-THC (\"drug-type\") varieties of hemp. As most of the phytocannabinoids are nearly insoluble in water, hemp essential oil contains only traces of cannabinoids. Even in \"drug-type\" hemp, the THC content of the essential oil does not exceed 0.08%.\n[1232085#1] Cannabidiol - Cannabidiol can be taken into the body in multiple different ways, including by inhalation of cannabis smoke or vapor, as an aerosol spray into the cheek, and by mouth. It may be supplied as CBD oil containing only CBD as the active ingredient (no added THC or terpenes), a full-plant CBD-dominant hemp extract oil, capsules, dried cannabis, or as a prescription liquid solution. CBD does not have the same psychoactivity as THC, and may affect the actions of THC. Although in vitro studies indicate CBD may interact with different biological targets, including cannabinoid receptors and other neurotransmitter receptors, the mechanism of action for its possible biological effects has not been determined, as of 2018.\n[1232085#22] Cannabidiol - Various strains of \"medical marijuana\" are found to have a significant variation in the ratios of CBD-to-THC, and are known to contain other non-psychotropic cannabinoids. Any psychoactive marijuana, regardless of its CBD content, is derived from the flower (or bud) of the genus \"Cannabis\". Non-psychoactive hemp (also commonly-termed industrial hemp), regardless of its CBD content, is any part of the cannabis plant, whether growing or not, containing a ∆-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of no more than 0.3% on a dry-weight basis. Certain standards are required for legal growing, cultivating, and producing the hemp plant. The Colorado Industrial Hemp Program registers growers of industrial hemp and samples crops to verify that the dry-weight THC concentration does not exceed 0.3%.\n[1481886#34] Cannabis (drug) - Marijuana or marihuana (herbal cannabis), consists of the dried flowers and subtending leaves and stems of the female \"Cannabis\" plant. This is the most widely consumed form, containing 3% to 20% THC, with reports of up-to 33% THC. This is the stock material from which all other preparations are derived. Although herbal cannabis and industrial hemp derive from the same species and contain the psychoactive component (THC), they are distinct strains with unique biochemical compositions and uses. Hemp has lower concentrations of THC and higher concentrations of CBD, which decreases the psychoactive effects\n[963313#1] Hemp - Although cannabis as a drug and industrial hemp both derive from the species \"Cannabis sativa\" and contain the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), they are distinct strains with unique phytochemical compositions and uses. Hemp has lower concentrations of THC and higher concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD), which decreases or eliminates its psychoactive effects. The legality of industrial hemp varies widely between countries. Some governments regulate the concentration of THC and permit only hemp that is bred with an especially low THC content.\n[963313#33] Hemp - \"Cannabis sativa\" L. subsp. \"sativa\" var. \"sativa\" is the variety grown for industrial use, while \"C. sativa\" subsp. \"indica\" generally has poor fiber quality and female buds from this variety are primarily used for recreational and medicinal purposes. The major differences between the two types of plants are the appearance, and the amount of Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) secreted in a resinous mixture by epidermal hairs called glandular trichomes, although they can also be distinguished genetically. Oilseed and fiber varieties of \"Cannabis\" approved for industrial hemp production produce only minute amounts of this psychoactive drug, not enough for any physical or psychological effects. Typically, hemp contains below 0.3% THC, while cultivars of \"Cannabis\" grown for medicinal or recreational use can contain anywhere from 2% to over 20%.\n[48517507#4] Hemp juice - Hemp juice cold-pressed from industrial hemp prior to seed maturation is an emulsion. This is because at the best time of harvest for industrial fiber the green hemp also contains the special omega oils, most cannabinoids as well as the other valuable ingredients in the suspended particles. All hemp varieties with a THC content of below 0,2% classify as industrial hemp in Europe (below 0.3% in the US and Canada) and are defined as drug-free foods and therefore legal under EU, US and Canadian law.\n[56074315#7] Cannabis in Ontario - Industrial hemp is the cannabis plant and variances that contain under 0.3% THC in the leaves and flowering heads. Under the \"Opium Narcotic Drug Act\" hemp production was prohibited in Canada in 1938 for the battle against THC abuse, now under the Controlled Drugs and Substance Act(CDSA) and subsection \"Industrial Hemp Regulation\"(IHR) permission of Canadian Farmer's under regulated approval the right to commercially produce industrial hemp on 12 March 1998.\n[35588776#6] Colorado Amendment 64 - The legislation defines industrial hemp as any part of the cannabis plant, growing or not, \"with a delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration that does not exceed three tenths percent (0.3%) on a dry weight basis.\" The amendment declares that industrial hemp should be regulated separately from marijuana with higher THC concentrations, and requires the Colorado General Assembly to \"enact legislation governing the cultivation, processing, and sale of industrial hemp\" by no later than July 1, 2014.\n[324632#2] Hemp oil - Hempseed oil is manufactured from varieties of \"Cannabis sativa\" that do not contain significant amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive element present in the cannabis plant. This manufacturing process typically includes cleaning the seed to 99.99% before pressing the oil. There is no THC within the hempseed, although trace amounts of THC may be found in hempseed oil when plant matter adheres to the seed surface during manufacturing. The modern production of hempseed oil, particularly in Canada, has successfully lowered THC values since 1998. Regular accredited sampling of THC in Canadian hemp seed oil shows THC levels usually below detection limit of 4 ppm (parts per million, or 4 mg/kg). Legal limit for THC content in foodstuffs in Canada is 10 ppm. Some European countries have limits of 5 ppm or none-detected, some EU countries do not have such limits at all.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Do UK House of Lords members get a salary?\n\nContexts: [18716641#19] Henry Lucy - The House of Commons is unique in many ways. I believe the main foundation of the position it holds among the parliaments of the world is the condition of volunteered unremunerated service.\nIn spite of the sneers from disappointed or flippant persons, a seat in the House of Commons remains one of the highest prizes of citizen life. There is no reason why any constituency desiring to do so may not return a member on the terms of paying him a salary. It is done in several cases, in two at least with the happiest results. \nIt would be a different thing to throw the whole place open with standing advertisement for eligible Members at a salary. The horde of impecunious babblers and busybodies attracted by such a bait would trample down the class of man who compose the present House of Commons and who are, in various ways, in touch with all the multiform interests of the nation. \"Strand Magazine\", 1883\n[22879440#19] Salaries of Members of the United Kingdom Parliament - Members of the House of Lords are not salaried. They can opt to receive a £305 per day attendance allowance, plus travel expenses and subsidised restaurant facilities. Peers may also choose to receive a reduced attendance allowance of £150 per day instead.\n[24170#100] Palace of Westminster - Although there is no casual access to the interior of the Palace, there are several ways to gain admittance. UK residents may obtain tickets from an MP for a place in the viewing (\"strangers\") gallery of the House of Commons, or from a Lord for a seat in the gallery of the House of Lords. It is also possible for both UK residents and overseas visitors to queue for admission to them at any time of the day or night when either House is in session, but capacity is limited and there is no guarantee of admission. Either House may exclude \"strangers\" if it desires to sit in private. Members of the public can also queue for a seat in a committee session, where admission is free and places cannot be booked, or they may visit the Parliamentary Archives for research purposes. Booking an appointment is necessary in the latter case, along with a proof of identity.\nFree guided tours of the Palace are held throughout the parliamentary session for UK residents, who can apply through their MP or a member of the House of Lords. The tours last about 75 minutes and include the state rooms, the chambers of the two Houses and Westminster Hall. Paid-for tours are available to both UK and overseas visitors during the summer recess. UK residents may also tour the Elizabeth Tower, by applying through their local MP; overseas visitors and small children are not allowed.\nArchitectural historian Dan Cruickshank selected the Palace as one of his five choices for the 2006 BBC television documentary series \"Britain's Best Buildings\".\n[87198#42] Judicial functions of the House of Lords - Judicial appeals were heard by Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and Lords of Appeal under the age of seventy-five. Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were entitled to emoluments. Thus, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary ceased to be paid at the time they ceased to hold office and became Lords of Appeal. The Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary received £185,705 as of 2009 (the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales was the only judicial figure who received a higher salary). The other Lords of Appeal in Ordinary received £179,431.\n[22879440#14] Salaries of Members of the United Kingdom Parliament - In the UK the first £30,000 of severance pay is tax free. As stated above, the amount retiring MPs, or those who lose their seats receive, depends on how old they are and how long they have served in the House. For example, an MP who stays in office for one term (say 5 years) and then leaves office will currently receive tax-free severance pay of 50% of his current salary, or £32,383 at current rates – equivalent to an annual salary increment of over £12,000 at current tax rates and pay scales.\n[849952#2] Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom) - The Leader of the Opposition, the Opposition Chief Whip and Opposition Deputy Chief Whip are the only Members of the Official Opposition to draw remuneration for their Opposition roles in addition to their salaries as Members of Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords also receive a salary.\n[13828#38] House of Commons of the United Kingdom - The term \"Member of Parliament\" by modern convention means members of the House of Commons. These members may, and almost invariably, use the post-nominal letters \"MP\". The annual salary of each member is £74,962, effective from 1 April 2016. Members may also receive additional salaries for other offices they hold (for instance, the Speakership). Most members also claim for various office expenses (staff costs, postage, travelling, etc.) and, in the case of non-London-area members, for the costs of maintaining a home in the capital.\n[2053256#28] Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom) - The corresponding affirmation is:\nThose elected to the House of Commons, to the Scottish Parliament, or to the Welsh Assembly who refuse to take the oath or affirmation are barred from participating in any proceedings, and from receiving their salaries. Members of the House of Commons could also be fined £500 and, have their seat declared vacant “as if [they] were dead” if they attempt to do so. Under the Parliamentary Oaths Act 1866, any peer voting, or sitting in the House of Lords without having taken the oath, is subject, for every such offence, to a penalty of £500. Members of the Scottish Parliament must take the oath within 2 months of being elected, failing which they cease to be members and their seat is vacated.\n[1457212#10] Lord Speaker - By Royal Warrant on 4 July 2006, the Queen declared that the Lord Speaker would have rank and precedence immediately after the Speaker of the House of Commons. The Lord Speaker earns a salary of £101,038, less than the Speaker of the House of Commons. The Lord Speaker, like the Speaker of the House of Commons, is entitled to a grace and favour apartment in the Parliamentary Estate.\n[24150#98] Prime Minister of the United Kingdom - In 2010 the Prime Minister received £142,500 including a salary of £65,737 as a member of parliament. Until 2006, the Lord Chancellor was the highest paid member of the government, ahead of the Prime Minister. This reflected the Lord Chancellor's position at the head of the judicial pay scale. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 eliminated the Lord Chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary to below that of the Prime Minister.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Are yaks related to cows?\n\nContexts: [145957#106] Chinese mythology - Oxen may includingrefer to the common cow, the buffalo), and the yak. The zodiacal ox is one of the twelve zodiacal signs in the twelve-year calendar cycle. Yak tails are mentioned as magical whisks used by Daoist sorcerors. The ox appears in various agricultural myths.\n[32294565#1] Yak butter - Yaks provide their herders with many different benefits, including dung for fuel, draught power, meat, fiber, and milk. Not all herding communities have a tradition of using yak's milk or making butter, although in regions of mountain pastures the practice is common. Each individual yak cow produces little milk, so only when large herds are present can herders expect much milk to be obtained. Milk is much more plentiful in summer than winter; turning fresh milk into butter or cheese is a way to store calories for later use.\n[1581463#0] Yakalo - The yakalo is a cross of the yak (\"Bos grunniens\") and the American bison (\"Bison bison\", known as a buffalo in North America). It was produced by hybridisation experiments in the 1920s, when crosses were made between yak bulls and both pure bison cows and bison-cattle hybrid cows. As with many other inter-specific crosses, only female hybrids were found to be fertile (Haldane's rule). Few of the hybrids survived, and the experiments were discontinued in 1928.\n[230271#6] Domestic yak - Yaks are heavily built animals with a bulky frame, sturdy legs, rounded cloven hooves, and extremely dense, long fur that hangs down lower than the belly. While wild yaks are generally dark, blackish to brown in colouration, domestic yaks can be quite variable in colour, often having patches of rusty brown and cream. They have small ears and a wide forehead, with smooth horns that are generally dark in colour. In males (bulls), the horns sweep out from the sides of the head, and then curve forward. They typically range from in length. The horns of females (cows) are smaller, only in length, and have a more upright shape. Both sexes have a short neck with a pronounced hump over the shoulders, although this is larger and more visible in males. Males weigh , females weigh . Wild yaks can be substantially heavier, bulls reaching weights of up to . Depending on the breed, domestic yak males are high at the withers, while females are high at the withers.\n[32625124#14] Organisms at high altitude - Among domesticated animals, yaks (\"Bos grunniens\") are the highest dwelling animals of the world, living at . The yak is the most important domesticated animal for Tibet highlanders in Qinghai Province of China, as the primary source of milk, meat and fertilizer. Unlike other yak or cattle species, which suffer from hypoxia in the Tibetan Plateau, the Tibetan domestic yaks thrive only at high altitude, and not in lowlands. Their physiology is well-adapted to high altitudes, with proportionately larger lungs and heart than other cattle, as well as greater capacity for transporting oxygen through their blood. In yaks, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (\"HIF-1\") has high expression in the brain, lung and kidney, showing that it plays an important role in the adaptation to low oxygen environment. On 1 July 2012 the complete genomic sequence and analyses of a female domestic yak was announced, providing important insights into understanding mammalian divergence and adaptation at high altitude. Distinct gene expansions related to sensory perception and energy metabolism were identified. In addition, researchers also found an enrichment of protein domains related to the extracellular environment and hypoxic stress that had undergone positive selection and rapid evolution. For example, they found three genes that may play important roles in regulating the bodyʼs response to hypoxia, and five genes that were related to the optimisation of the energy from the food scarcity in the extreme plateau. One gene known to be involved in regulating response to low oxygen levels, ADAM17, is also found in human Tibetan highlanders.\n[230271#1] Domestic yak - The English word \"yak\" is a loan originating from . In Tibetan, it refers only to the male of the species, the female being called , or \"g.nag\" . In English, as in most other languages that have borrowed the word, \"yak\" is usually used for both sexes, with \"bull\" or \"cow\" referring to each sex separately.\n[32294565#0] Yak butter - Yak butter/ \"Dri Butter\" འབྲི་མར། is butter made from the milk of the domesticated female yak known as Dri འབྲི། (\"Bos grunniens\"). It is a staple food item and trade item for herding communities in south Central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau. Many different political entities have communities of herders who produce and consume yak's dairy products including cheese and butter – for example, China, India, Mongolia, Nepal, and Tibet.\nWhole yak's milk has about twice the fat content of whole cow's milk, producing a butter with a texture closer to cheese.\nThe English word \"yak\" is a loan originating from Tibetan: གཡག་, Wylie: g.ya. In Tibetan, it refers only to the male of the species, the female being called Tibetan: འབྲི་, Wylie: 'bri, or nak. In English, as in most other languages that have borrowed the word, \"yak\" is usually used for both sexes.\n[230271#2] Domestic yak - Yaks belong to the genus \"Bos\" and are therefore related to cattle (\"Bos primigenius\" species). Mitochondrial DNA analyses to determine the evolutionary history of yaks have been inconclusive.\n[2706031#10] Bovid hybrid - In Tibet and Mongolia, yaks are quite often crossbred to dairy cattle, the result being known as \"dzo\" or \"zho\". The offspring are used as milk cows, if female, or as oxen, if male.\n[2706031#16] Bovid hybrid - American bison has been bred with the domestic Tibetan yak to create the yakalo.\nDomestic yak bulls mated with bison cows produced fully fecund progeny, both sexes. Male yak bred to beefalo produced fertile females and sterile males. The appearance of the yak X bison hybrid is strongly reminiscent morphologically to Bison latifrons.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What is the difference between a telenovela and a soap opera?\n\nContexts: [27009#4] Soap opera - Soap opera storylines run concurrently, intersect and lead into further developments. An individual episode of a soap opera will generally switch between several different concurrent narrative threads that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independent to each other. Each episode may feature some of the show's current storylines, but not always all of them. Especially in daytime serials and those that are broadcast each weekday, there is some rotation of both storyline and actors so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week's worth of episodes. Soap operas rarely bring all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time. When one storyline ends, there are several other story threads at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliffhanger, and the season finale (if a soap incorporates a break between seasons) ends in the same way, only to be resolved when the show returns for the start of a new yearly broadcast.\n[26536200#78] Telenovela - Telenovelas also have a different type of story from English-language soaps, the typical telenovela story being focused on a rivalry between two or more people or families in romance or business. Many of them use stock themes like a cinderella (who is a rival of the male protagonist's evil girlfriend), two brothers after one woman (or two sisters after one man) or mistaken/unknown parentage. Typically, the hero gets shot (or some form of fate equivalent to that).\n[26536200#0] Telenovela - A telenovela ( or ; , , ) is a type of limited-run television serial drama or soap opera produced primarily in Latin America. The word combines \"tele\", short for \"televisión\" or \"televisão\" (Spanish and Portuguese words for \"television\"), and \"novela\", a Spanish and Portuguese word for \"novel\". Similar genres around the world include teleserye (Philippines), téléroman (Canada, specifically Quebec), or simply dramas (Asia and the rest of the Arab World). In Spain, they are also called \"culebrones\" (\"long snakes\") because of the convoluted plots.\n[330102#16] Social learning theory - Entertainment-education in the form of a telenovela or soap opera can help viewers learn socially desired behaviors in a positive way from models portrayed in these programs. The telenovela format allows the creators to incorporate elements that can bring a desired response. These elements may include music, actors, melodrama, props or costumes. Entertainment education is symbolic modeling and has a formula with three sets of characters with the cultural value that is to be examined is determined ahead of time:\n[27009#51] Soap opera - The telenovela, a shorter-form format of serial melodrama, shares some thematic and especially stylistic similarity to the soap opera, enough that the colloquialism \"Spanish soap opera\" has arisen to describe the format. The chief difference between the two is length of series; while soap operas usually have indefinite runs, telenovelas typically have a central story arc with a prescribed ending within a year or two of the show's launch, requiring more concise storytelling.\n[26536200#1] Telenovela - Commonly described using the American colloquialism Spanish soap opera, many telenovelas share some stylistic and thematic similarities to the soap opera familiar to the English-speaking world. The significant difference is their series run length; telenovelas tell one self-contained story, typically within the span of a year or less whereas soap operas tend to have intertwined storylines told during indefinite, continuing runs. This makes them shorter than most other television series, but still much longer than a miniseries. This planned run results in a faster-paced, more concise style of melodrama compared to a typical soap opera. Episodes of telenovelas usually last between 30 and 45 minutes, and rarely more than an hour, except for final episodes. The telenovela combines drama with the 19th-century \"feuilleton\", and naturally evolved from the Latin American radionovela, according to Blanca de Lizaur.\n[26536200#77] Telenovela - The standard American, British or Australian soap opera is of indefinite length, sometimes running for decades, with an ever-rotating cast of players and characters. However, most Latin American telenovelas have an average run of six months up to a year. The show's duration is pre-planned at the show's inception, with the overall story arc and conclusion also known by the show's creators and producers at its inception. \"Mundo de Juguete\" is one exception to the rule, with a total of 605 chapters (1974–1977), and a few cast changes during the course of the serial. Some earlier Argentine telenovelas (most of them written by Alberto Migré) had also run for a few years.\n[12354665#26] MyNetworkTV telenovelas - MyNetwork promoted its telenovelas as trashy melodramas, resembling prime time soap operas like \"Dallas\" and \"Dynasty\". Paul Buccieri called them \"guilty pleasures\" and compared them to beach novels. While these shows attempted to adhere to the telenovela format and tone, the network's executives and producers developed their own campy interpretation of the genre. They added characters and situations that differed from the Latin American originals. As telenovelas are inherently implausible and cartoonish, both Hispanic and non-Hispanic audiences scorned the new adaptations.\n[311067#42] Culture of Brazil - Telenovelas are a marking feature in Brazilian television, usually being broadcast in prime time on most major television networks. Telenovelas are similar in concept to soap operas in English-speaking countries but differ from them in duration, telenovelas being significantly shorter (usually about 100 to 200 episodes). They are widely watched throughout the country, to the point that they have been described as a significant element in national identity and unity, and have been exported to over 120 countries.\n[26536200#58] Telenovela - Korean telenovelas include a genre similar to the soap opera, but without the neverending plot and frank sexual content. These dramas typically involve conflicts around dating and marital relationships, money problems, relationships between family members and in-laws (usually between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law), and often complicated love triangles with the heroine usually falls in love with the main character who may treat her badly for a while instead of the one who always cares for her. Korean telenovelas run for 100+ episodes (rarely exceed 200) and air from Monday to Friday. The main broadcasters and producers are KBS, MBC and SBS.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When were stradivarius violins made?\n\nContexts: [9038551#10] John Dalley - Dalley plays a Nicolas Lupot violin, made in France in 1810. Some years ago the quartet members were approached by the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., which made a very generous offer of possible extended use by the quartet of its rare Stradivarius instruments. Antonio Stradivarius of Cremona produced a life-time of fine instruments. At the time of the offer, there were only 500 violins, fifty cellos, and ten violas still extant. Although much less rare than the Stradivarii, the specific venerable instruments owned and played by the quartet's members, with their craftsmanship, type of wood, varnish, and all of substantial age, together \"created such a warmth and complexity of sound that enticed, then seduced each of us.\" The offer to use the Stradivarii was politely declined. At this writing Dalley has been playing the violin for 75 years. He refers to his violin as his friend.\n[21179809#4] Air and Simple Gifts - Yo-Yo Ma played his Stradivarius cello called the \"Davidov Stradivarius\", made in 1712 during Stradivari's \"golden period\". Itzhak Perlman played his Stradivarius violin called the \"Soil Stradivarius\", made in 1714 during Stradivari's \"golden period\". Gabriela Montero played a Steinway concert grand piano, model D-274. Anthony McGill played a Buffet clarinet.\n[620574#32] Paavo Berglund - According to the Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE, Berglund's Stradivarius violin was sold by his heirs in 2012 to the Finnish Cultural Foundation for 1.8 million euros. At the same time the performing artist's rights to Berglund's recordings as well as his valuable collection of orchestral sheet music were donated to the foundation. The latter material will be made available to researchers in ten years' time. The violin will be named Stradivarius ex. Berglund. Mr Berglund's son Juha Berglund, the spokesperson for the family, says that his father had several instruments, but the Stradivari was the dearest to him. Mr Berglund's specific wish was that the violin should stay in Finland. The violin was built in around 1700. The violin is in exceptionally good condition for its age.\n[30900400#0] Molitor Stradivarius - The Molitor Stradivarius is an antique violin made by Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari of Cremona in 1697, the very beginning of the maker's celebrated \"Golden\" period. It bears the label \"Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis / Faciebat Anno 1697\" and is branded to the lower rib, \"Curtis Phila.\"\n[34269687#14] Player preferences among new and old violins - There have been many comparisons of Stradivarius and other old violins with more recent violins since 1817. They generally have found no differences in either subjective impressions or acoustic analysis. However, the tests have been criticized on various grounds. In a well-known 1977 experiment, Isaac Stern and Pinchas Zukerman and a classical violin dealer, Charles Beare, listened to a Stradivarius, a Guarneri, and a 1976 British violin. They were also unable to identify which instrument was which, and two of them mistakenly identified the 1976 violin as the Stradivarius.\n[1831908#0] Messiah Stradivarius - The Messiah-Salabue Stradivarius of 1716 is a violin made by Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari of Cremona. It is considered to be the only Stradivarius in existence in \"as new\" state. It is in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England.\n[31681059#5] Lady Blunt Stradivarius - The Lady Blunt is one of the two best-preserved Stradivarius violins in existence. It has survived, like the Messiah Stradivarius of 1716, in near-original condition, since it has resided mostly in the hands of collectors and seen little use. It was built on the PG form, being a mature golden period violin. The violin also retains its original neck. It has been played very rarely; Yehudi Menuhin played it in 1971, when the instrument was up for sale. In 2011 it was described as \"the best-preserved Stradivarius to be offered for sale in the past century.\"\n[34482345#3] Jean Joseph Bott - In 1885 he came to New York. While in the United States, he made it a practice to visit Hamburg every summer. He reportedly died from grief over the loss of his 1725 Stradivarius violin, which was stolen from him on 31 March 1894. It was his favorite, and he would play on no other in a concert. After Bott's death, a violin was found in the store of Victor S. Fletcher at 23 Union Square which his widow said was the stolen violin. She pointed to various identifying features, and two violin makers, August Gemünder and John Friedrich, testified that it was a Stradivarius, contradicting a Mr. Ross who had purchased the violin from Fletcher and said he did not think it a Stradivarius.\n[207810#11] Jacqueline du Pré - Du Pré primarily played on two Stradivarius cellos, one from 1673 and the Davidov Stradivarius of 1712. Both instruments were gifts from her godmother, Ismena Holland. She performed with the 1673 Stradivarius from 1961 until 1964, when she acquired the Davidov. Many of her most famous recordings were made on this instrument, including the Elgar Concerto with Barbirolli, the Robert Schumann Cello Concerto with Barenboim and the two Brahms cello sonatas. From 1969 to 1970 she (like Casals before her) played on a Francesco Goffriller cello, and in 1970 acquired a modern instrument from the Philadelphia violin maker Sergio Peresson. It was the Peresson cello that du Pré played for the remainder of her career until 1973, using it for a second, live, recording of the Elgar Concerto, and her last studio recording, of Frédéric Chopin's Cello Sonata in G minor and César Franck's Violin Sonata in A arranged for cello, in December 1971.\n[22954024#15] Henri Temianka - In his teens Temianka played a Laurentius Storioni of 1780. While traveling under the aegis of the Curtis Institute, he briefly played a loaned Stradivarius, which was exchanged for a Januarius Gagliano. In 1929 Temianka owned the violin made in 1752 by Joannes Baptista Guadagnini. In the 1930s he played a Silvestre violin, with which he made his early Vintage recordings, and subsequently a Januarius Gagliano and a Carlo Bergonzi.\nThe Stradivarius he played during the years of the Paganini Quartet was the \"Comte Cozio di Salabue\" of 1727, which was Paganini's own concert violin. It was later played by Martin Beaver, first violinist of the Tokyo String Quartet, which played since 1995 on the same quartet of Stradivarius instruments once owned by Paganini, until the Tokyo String Quartet retired in July 2013. These remarkable instruments—the viola had inspired Paganini to commission Hector Berlioz's \"Harold en Italie\"—were also played by the Cleveland Quartet for almost 15 years, beginning in 1982, and are presently owned by Nippon Music Foundation of Japan, after deacquisition by the Corcoran Gallery in the mid-1990s for $15 million. They were then played for several years by the Hagen Quartet, and are now in the hands of the Quartetto di Cremona.\nWhen the years of the Paganini Quartet came to an end, Temianka played a Michelangelo Bergonzi of 1759. His recordings of the Handel Sonatas were made on an Andrea Guarneri of 1687.In February 2013, Chapman University endowed the Henri Temianka Professorship in Music and Scholarship in String Studies. The violin played by Albert Saparoff, concertmaster of the Hollywood Symphony, was endowed as the Temianka-Saparoff violin, and is dedicated for the use of a selected recipient while studying there.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Where did Rugby originate?\n\nContexts: [249140#15] Rugby, Tennessee - In 1966, preservationists formed Historic Rugby, a non-profit group dedicated to restoring and maintaining the community's surviving historic structures, which include the Christ Church Episcopal, the Thomas Hughes Library, the Rugby School, Kingstone Lisle, Uffington House, and Newbury House. The group has also reconstructed several buildings based on their original designs, including the Board of Aid office, the Rugby Commissary, and Sir Henry Kimber's Percy Cottage. The Harrow Road Cafe, a restaurant built in the 1980s, was named for a restaurant that existed at Rugby in the 1880s, although its original design is unknown. The Rugby Printing Works, which originally stood at nearby Deer Lodge, was moved to Rugby in the 1970s. Historic Rugby opened up the community's Beacon Hill area (originally planned to include residences and a park) to new home construction, with the condition that all new homes must be designed in accordance with the community's Victorian aesthetic.\n[41959688#0] Winfield Toll Bridge - Winfield Toll Bridge, also known as the Ross Booth Memorial Bridge, is a historic three-span cantilever Warren Truss bridge located at Winfield and Red House, Putnam County, West Virginia. It was built in 1955, and spans the Kanawha River, carrying West Virginia Route 34. The cantilever through-truss consists of two anchor spans each 245 feet in length and the main span 462 feet in length between pier center lines. The main span consists of two 128 feet, 4 inch, cantilever arms and a 205 feet, 4 inch, suspended span.\n[13842681#14] Rugby Road - An integral part of Rugby Road is \"Beta Bridge\". In the 1850s, a bridge was erected over the Chesapeake and Ohio train tracks in the location of what is now Beta Bridge, but the current structure was built in 1923. The bridge was a part of a citywide paving and improvement project to prepare Charlottesville area streets for the automobile. Although it was originally known simply as the Rugby Road Bridge, when the Beta Theta Pi fraternity built their house at the corner of Chancellor and Rugby in 1927, it took its current name. In 1971, that fraternity location was closed, and the Delta Upsilon fraternity moved into its current location at 180 Rugby Road. As the unofficial monitors of the bridge, brothers and pledges of DU would paint over offensive messages or messages which did not contain 'THX DU' (for \"Thanks Delta Upsilon\"). In 2011, Beta Theta Pi moved back into their original house next to the bridge, and now messages typically contain 'THX Beta'.\n[25402#0] Rugby football - Rugby refers to the team sports rugby league and rugby union. Legend claims that Rugby football was started around the time of 1845 in Rugby School, Rugby, Warwickshire, England, although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times. Rugby eventually split into two sports in 1895 when twenty one clubs split from the original Rugby Football Union, to form the Northern Union (later to be named rugby league in 1922) in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, Northern England over the issue of payment to players, thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay its players, rugby union turned fully professional in 1995. Both sports are run by their respective world governing bodies World Rugby (rugby union) and the Rugby League International Federation (rugby league). Rugby football was one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports. In addition to these two codes, both American and Canadian football evolved from rugby football.\n[1291544#4] Rugby League Ireland - In 1996, the inaugural Ireland \"State of Origin\" series was established between Northern Ireland and the Republic where representatives of the club teams engaged in the All-Ireland competition played for each region over a 3 match competition. The inaugural winner was the Southern team. Some of the players involved in the State of Origin series from both regions over the next few years included some of the original stalwarts of Rugby League in Ireland: Eric Doyle, Phelim Comerford, Rickey Smith, Innes Gray, Brian Carney, Sean Cleary, Gavin Gordon, Peter McNamara, [Dara MacCarthy], Gavin Lee, Paul Ryan, Conor O'Sullivan, Neil Ryan, Ernie Hendy, Dave Moore, Garret Molloy,Dara MacCarthy Mick Molloy and Mick Browne.\n[25735#23] Rugby league - The Rugby League European Federation are responsible for developing rugby league in Europe and the Northern Hemisphere,\nIn England, rugby league has traditionally been associated with the northern counties of Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria where the game originated, especially in towns along the M62 corridor. Its popularity has also increased elsewhere. Currently, only one of the twelve Super League teams is based outside of these traditional counties: Catalans Dragons (Perpignan). Two other teams from outside the United Kingdom, the Toronto Wolfpack and Toulouse Olympique, also compete in the English Rugby League system. Both teams will play in the Rugby League Championship in 2018.\n[770930#4] Wales national rugby union team - Rugby union took root in Wales in 1850, when Reverend Rowland Williams became Vice-Principal at St David's College, Lampeter, where he introduced the sport. Wales played their first international on 19 February 1881; organised by Newport's Richard Mullock, Wales played against England, losing by seven goals, one drop goal and six tries to nil (8–0). On 12 March 1881, the Welsh Rugby Union was formed at The Castle Hotel, Neath. Two years later, the Home Nation Championshipnow the Six Nations Championshipwas first played and Wales did not register a win. However, rugby in Wales developed and, by the 1890s, the Welsh had developed the four three-quarters formation. This formation – with seven backs and eight forwards, instead of six backs and nine forwards – revolutionised the sport and was eventually adopted almost universally at international and club level.\n[594653#0] Rugby railway station - Rugby railway station serves the town of Rugby in Warwickshire, England. It opened during the Victorian era, in 1885, replacing earlier stations situated a little further west. Since the closure of the former Rugby Central station on the now-abandoned Great Central Railway route through the town, it is Rugby's only station. Between 1950 and 1970 the station was known as Rugby Midland before reverting to its original title. The station underwent an extensive upgrade during 2006–2008, with extra platforms added, and a new ticket office and entrance building constructed, however the original Victorian part of the station was retained in the upgrade.\n[128672#2] Rugby, North Dakota - Rugby was founded in 1886 at a junction on the Great Northern Railway, where a branch line to Bottineau met the main line. The railroad promoters initially platted the town as Rugby Junction, getting the name Rugby from the town of Rugby in Warwickshire, England. It was one of several sites along the Great Northern's transcontinental route between Devils Lake and Minot that were named after places in England (the others were Berwick, Leeds, Knox, \nNorwich, Penn, Surrey, Churches Ferry, Tunbridge, and York). When the community became a city, the \"Junction\" was dropped from the name.\n[49821086#1] The Rugby Club - The Rugby Club was formed in 1945 and was originally the Headquarters of the New South Wales Rugby Union and later the Australian Rugby Union and was where Wallabies touring teams were presented their jerseys. It was also where the Australian Rugby Union and New Zealand Rugby Union Boards agreed to establish the Rugby World Cup and later the Super Rugby and Tri-Nations competitions and the clubhouse of Sydney Harlequins who Participate in the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union.\n[249140#0] Rugby, Tennessee - Rugby is an unincorporated community in Morgan and Scott counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Founded in 1880 by English author Thomas Hughes, Rugby was built as an experimental utopian colony. While Hughes's experiment largely failed, a small community lingered at Rugby throughout the 20th century. In the 1960s, residents, friends and descendants of Rugby began restoring the original design and layout of the community, preserving surviving structures and reconstructing others. Rugby's Victorian architecture and picturesque setting have since made it a popular tourist attraction. In 1972, Rugby's historic area was listed under the name Rugby Colony on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

Grumbach - Grumbach made many seminal contributions the understanding of pediatric endocrinology including extensive studies on the development and function of the endocrine and neuroendocrine systems from fetal life through puberty, as well as studies of the hormonal and genetic effects on growth, bone maturation, puberty, sex determination and differentiation (and their disorders) and disease-causing pathology. He was a past president of the Endocrine Society, the American Pediatric Society, the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, the Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairmen, and honorary president of the International Endocrine Society. From 1956 to 1990 he supervised the training of 82 fellows from 15 countries on five continents. No single individual trained as many leaders or had a broader impact on Pediatric Endocrinology. He died on October 4, 2016 of a heart attack.\n[9311#21] Endocrinology - Although most of the relevant tissues and endocrine glands had been identified by early anatomists, a more humoral approach to understanding biological function and disease was favoured by the ancient Greek and Roman thinkers such as Aristotle, Hippocrates, Lucretius, Celsus, and Galen, according to Freeman et al., and these theories held sway until the advent of germ theory, physiology, and organ basis of pathology in the 19th century.\n[903152#27] Endocrine disruptor - An analysis of the endocrine disrupting chemicals in Old Order Mennonite women in mid-pregnancy determined that they have much lower levels in their systems than the general population. Mennonites eat mostly fresh, unprocessed foods, farm without pesticides, and use few or no cosmetics or personal care products. One woman who had reported using hairspray and perfume had high levels of monoethyl phthalate, while the other women all had levels below detection. Three women who reported being in a car or truck within 48 hours of providing a urine sample had higher levels of diethylhexyl phthalate which is found in polyvinyl chloride, and is used in car interiors.\n[903152#5] Endocrine disruptor - The term \"endocrine disruptor\" was coined at the Wingspread Conference Centre in Wisconsin, in 1991. One of the early papers on the phenomenon was by Theo Colborn in 1993. In this paper, she stated that environmental chemicals disrupt the development of the endocrine system, and that effects of exposure during development are often permanent.\nAlthough the endocrine disruption has been disputed by some, work sessions from 1992 to 1999 have generated consensus statements from scientists regarding the hazard from endocrine disruptors, particularly in wildlife and also in humans.\n[25901891#3] James Hardy (surgeon) - Hardy served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps in early 1944 during the Second World War. He first worked at Stark General Hospital, Charleston in South Carolina. Hardy began writing his first book, \"Surgery and the Endocrine System\", in 1950 which was published two years later. He was awarded the Master of Medical Science in physiological chemistry by the University of Pennsylvania in 1951 for his research on using heavy water for measuring body fluids. He became the chair of surgery at the University of Mississippi School of Medicine, Jackson in 1955. He was also the first Professor of Surgery at the University of Mississippi School of Medicine.\n[9312#0] Endocrine system - The endocrine system is a chemical messenger system consisting of hormones, the group of glands of an organism that secrete those hormones directly into the circulatory system to regulate the function of distant target organs, and the feedback loops which modulate hormone release so that homeostasis is maintained. In humans, the major endocrine glands are the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The study of the endocrine system and its disorders is known as endocrinology. Endocrinology is a branch of internal medicine.\n[903152#64] Endocrine disruptor - In 1998, the EPA announced the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program by establishment of a framework for priority setting, screening and testing more than 85,000 chemicals in commerce. While the Food Quality Protection Act only required the EPA to screen pesticides for potential to produce effects similar to estrogens in humans, it also gave the EPA the authority to screen other types of chemicals and endocrine effects. Based recommendations from an advisory panel, the agency expanded the screening program to include male hormones, the thyroid system, and effects on fish and other wildlife. The basic concept behind the program is that prioritization will be based on existing information about chemical uses, production volume, structure-activity and toxicity. Screening is done by use of \"in vitro\" test systems (by examining, for instance, if an agent interacts with the estrogen receptor or the androgen receptor) and via the use of in animal models, such as development of tadpoles and uterine growth in prepubertal rodents. Full scale testing will examine effects not only in mammals (rats) but also in a number of other species (frogs, fish, birds and invertebrates). Since the theory involves the effects of these substances on a functioning system, animal testing is essential for scientific validity, but has been opposed by animal rights groups. Similarly, proof that these effects occur in humans would require human testing, and such testing also has opposition.\n[48378306#0] Corpuscle of Stannius - The corpuscles of Stannius are special endocrine organs in the kidney in fish and are responsible for maintaining calcium balance. They are found only in bony fishes. They were discovered and described by a German anatomist Hermann Friedrich Stannius in 1839. Stannius considered them as functionally similar to adrenal glands in mammals. But they have later been found to be anatomically different as they are derived from different tissues of the embryo. Structurally the corpuscles are a large number of spherical bodies separated from each other by loose connective tissues. Each body or lobule is in turn composed of several columnar cells, which contain secretory granules and are, thus, secretory in function. Each Secretory granule is spherical in shape and measures 0.5 to 1 μm in diameter. Their possible endocrine nature, i.e. producing hormone, was suspected from the complete anatomical description, and it was believed to be responsible for regulating calcium level in the blood. The hormone was identified as stanniocalcin.\n[41413136#0] Development of the endocrine system - The fetal endocrine system is one of the first systems to develop during prenatal development.\n[55823225#3] List of human endocrine organs and actions - In 1998, skeletal muscle was identified as an endocrine organ due to its now well-established role in the secretion of myokines. The use of the term myokine to describe cytokines and other peptides produced by muscle as signalling molecules was proposed in 2003.\n[9311#20] Endocrinology - The earliest study of endocrinology began in China. The Chinese were isolating sex and pituitary hormones from human urine and using them for medicinal purposes by 200 BCE. They used many complex methods, such as sublimation of steroid hormones. Another method specified by Chinese texts—the earliest dating to 1110—specified the use of saponin (from the beans of \"Gleditsia sinensis\") to extract hormones, but gypsum (containing calcium sulfate) was also known to have been used.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When did the Hundred Years' War begin?\n\nContexts: [19038039#0] Hundred Years' War - The Hundred Years' War was a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 by the House of Plantagenet, rulers of the Kingdom of England, against the French House of Valois, over the right to rule the Kingdom of France. Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the Middle Ages, in which five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in Western Europe. The war marked both the height of chivalry and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong national identities in both countries.\n[1547153#33] Hundred Years' War (1337–1360) - The Black Death had reached England in 1348. The widespread effects of the plague had effectively put the war on hold. However, by the mid-1350s the disease had receded sufficiently to allow the country to start rebuilding its finances. So in 1355 Edward's son, Edward the Black Prince, resumed the war and invaded France from English-held Gascony and by August of that year he had begun a brutal campaign of raids known as \"chevauchée\". This campaign was designed to terrorise and demoralise the people, discredit their leaders and drain the French king's financial resources. Anything that was portable was looted and anything that could not be taken away was broken or burnt. An observer at the time said, of the Black Prince, that \"as he rode to Toulouse there was no town that he did not lay waste.\"\n[19038039#72] Hundred Years' War - The Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke Charles of Burgundy, counting on English support, took up arms against Louis XI. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying Edward IV of England off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in the Treaty of Picquigny (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to claim the title until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King Louis XVIII, who was living in England after the French Revolution.\n[4305070#32] History of Western civilization - The last centuries of the Middle Ages saw the waging of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. The war began in 1337 when the king of France laid claim to English-ruled Gascony in southern France, and the king of England claimed to be the rightful king of France. At first, the English conquered half of France and seemed likely to win the war, until the French were rallied by a peasant girl, who would later become a saint, Joan of Arc. Although she was captured and executed by the English, the French fought on and won the war in 1453. After the war, France gained all of Normandy excluding the city of Calais, which it gained in 1558.\n[1547153#27] Hundred Years' War (1337–1360) - On 5 July 1346, Edward set sail from Portsmouth with about 750 ships and 7,000–10,000 men, beginning a major invasion across the Channel. With him was his nearly 16-year-old son, Edward, the Black Prince (Edward of Woodstock), the recently created Prince of Wales. On 12 July, Edward landed at Hague in the Cotentin peninsula of Normandy. Jean Froissart wrote in his \"Chronicles\" that:\n[14944095#15] 1345 - By 1345, the Hundred Years' War between France and England had been going on for only about eight years. The English claimed the right to the French throne, and the French refused to be ruled by foreigners. In August the English Earl of Derby commenced the Gascon campaign of 1345, taking a large French army at Bergerac, Dordogne by surprise and decisively defeating it. Later in the campaign, on 21 October the French were besieging the castle at Auberoche, when Derby's army caught them off guard during their evening meal and won one of the most decisive battles of the war. This set the stage for English dominance in the area for several years. Previous to this, the French had been having success, and the English had even offered a treaty, but with this battle along with Derby's overrunning of the Agenais (lost twenty years before in the War of Saint-Sardos) and Angoulême, as well as the forces in Brittany under Sir Thomas Dagworth also making gains, the tide turned somewhat in this year.\n[29034533#1] Knights of the Hare - At the beginning of the Hundred Years' War Edward III and Philip VI of France both assembled armies in France, but they did not engage in any decisive battle. On 23 October 1339, both armies were formed in sight of each other in the fields between La Flamengerie and Buironfosse, when a hare, caught in the field between them, started running towards the French lines. The French troops greeted the approaching hare with a lot of noise. Some troops at the rear of the French formation mistook the noise as a sign of an imminent English attack and prepared for battle. As a preparation for the battle the William II, Count of Hainaut quickly knighted 14 distinguished squires as was the common chivalric custom. However the English attack never came and, after the reason for that became clear, those knights became known as the \"Knights of the Hare\".\n[19038039#4] Hundred Years' War - Historians commonly divide the war into three phases separated by truces: the Edwardian War (1337–1360), the Caroline War (1369–1389), and the Lancastrian War (1415–1453). Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the War of the Breton Succession (1341–1365), the Castilian Civil War (1366–1369), the War of the Two Peters (1356–1369) in Aragon, and the 1383–85 crisis in Portugal, were availed by the parties to advance their agendas. Later historians adopted the term \"Hundred Years' War\" as a historiographical periodisation to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in European history.\n[6461518#0] Hundred Years' War (1415–53) - The Lancastrian War was the third and final phase of the Anglo-French Hundred Years' War. It lasted from 1415, when King Henry V of England invaded Normandy, to 1453, when the English lost Bordeaux. It followed a long period of peace from the end of the Caroline War in 1389. The phase was named after the House of Lancaster, the ruling house of the Kingdom of England, to which Henry V belonged.\n[40906043#9] John Crabbe (died 1352) - The year 1337 marked the beginning of the Hundred Years War. According to Lucas, Edward III's strategy was to use the Low Countries as his base and to finance the war from the sale of English wool there. It was thus imperative that the sea lanes be kept free for English shipping. Crabbe was well positioned to serve the King in this task, and from 4 April to 12 August 1339 was with the Admiral of the Fleet North of the Thames, Robert de Morley, 2nd Baron Morley. During this period he is known to have been in command, at one time, of a hundred archers, and on a second occasion, of eight men-at-arms, seventy archers and seventy sailors.\nIn an attempt to prevent the English from using the Low Countries as their base, Philip VI of France gathered a fleet at the mouths of the Zwin and Scheldt, and Edward III, prepared to attack immediately, met at Orwell with his council, where John de Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury, Morley and Crabbe urged him to delay until a larger fleet could be assembled. The King did so with reluctance, and with a larger fleet engaged the French in the Battle of Sluys on the afternoon of 23 June; by the end of the day the English had virtually annihilated the enemy. A few French ships led by a pirate named Spoudevisch managed to escape, and at the King's order were pursued by Crabbe. Unfortunately whether Crabbe succeeded or failed in this endeavour is unknown. After Sluys, Crabbe may have accompanied the King to the siege of Tournai.\n[1328501#0] Hundred Days Offensive - The Hundred Days Offensive (8 August to 11 November 1918) was an Allied offensive which ended the First World War. Beginning with the Battle of Amiens (8–12 August) on the Western Front, the Allies pushed Central Powers back after their gains from the Spring Offensive. The Germans eventually retreated to the Hindenburg Line, culminating in the Armistice of 11 November 1918. The term \"Hundred Days Offensive\" does not refer to a battle or strategy, but rather the rapid series of Allied victories against which the German armies had no reply.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

The trench is 1,700 miles (2,750 km) long and is 21,880 feet (6,669 m) at its deepest point.\nThe trench is the boundary between the Rivera, Cocos, and Nazca plates on one side and the North American and Caribbean plates on the other. It is the 18th-deepest trench in the world. Many large earthquakes have occurred in the area of the Middle America Trench.\n[18842359#20] Ocean - The deepest point in the ocean is the Mariana Trench, located in the Pacific Ocean near the Northern Mariana Islands. Its maximum depth has been estimated to be (plus or minus 11 meters; see the Mariana Trench article for discussion of the various estimates of the maximum depth.) The British naval vessel \"Challenger II\" surveyed the trench in 1951 and named the deepest part of the trench the \"Challenger Deep\". In 1960, the Trieste successfully reached the bottom of the trench, manned by a crew of two men.\n[2364038#0] Yap Trench - The Yap Trench is an oceanic trench near Yap Island in the western Pacific Ocean. The trench forms the part of the Pacific Ring of Fire between the Palau Islands and the Mariana Trench. It is 650 kilometres (400 mi) long and 8,527 metres (27,976 ft) deep at its deepest point.\n[23070#1] Pacific Ocean - At in area (as defined with an Antarctic southern border), this largest division of the World Ocean—and, in turn, the hydrosphere—covers about 46% of Earth's water surface and about one-third of its total surface area, making it larger than all of Earth's land area combined. The centers of both the Water Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere are in the Pacific Ocean. The equator subdivides it into the North Pacific Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, with two exceptions: the Galápagos and Gilbert Islands, while straddling the equator, are deemed wholly within the South Pacific. Its mean depth is . The Mariana Trench in the western North Pacific is the deepest point in the world, reaching a depth of . The western Pacific has many peripheral seas.\n[20702236#0] Juan Fernández Plate - The Juan Fernandez Plate is a microplate in the Pacific Ocean. With a surface area of approximately 10 km, the microplate is located between 32° and 35°S and 109° and 112°W. The plate is located at a triple junction between the Pacific Plate, Antarctic Plate, and Nazca Plate. Approximately 2000 km to the west of South America, it is, on average, 3000 meters deep with its shallowest point coming to approximately 1600 meters, and its deepest point reaching 4400 meters.\n[18842323#21] Sea - The Earth's deepest trench is the Mariana Trench which extends for about across the seabed. It is near the Mariana Islands, a volcanic archipelago in the West Pacific, and though it averages just wide, its deepest point is 10.994 kilometres (nearly 7 miles) below the surface of the sea. An even longer trench runs alongside the coast of Peru and Chile, reaching a depth of and extending for approximately . It occurs where the oceanic Nazca Plate slides under the continental South American Plate and is associated with the upthrust and volcanic activity of the Andes.\n[1354339#0] Puerto Rico Trench - The Puerto Rico Trench is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The oceanic trench is associated with a complex transition between the Lesser Antilles subduction zone to the south and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which extends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trough to the coast of Central America. The trench is long and has a maximum depth of or 5.20 miles in the Brownson Deep, which is the deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean and the deepest point not in the Pacific Ocean. On December 19, 2018, its deepest point was identified by the DSSV Pressure Drop using a state-of-the-art Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar and then directly visited and its depth verified by the manned submersible DSV Limiting Factor.\n[19036#0] Mariana Trench - The Mariana Trench or Marianas Trench is located in the western Pacific Ocean approximately east of the Mariana Islands, and has the deepest natural trench in the world. It is a crescent-shaped trough in the Earth's crust averaging about long and wide. The maximum known depth is (± ) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep. However, some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at . For comparison: if Mount Everest were dropped into the trench at this point, its peak would still be over under water.\n[23070#0] Pacific Ocean - The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.\n[25223506#2] DeepFlight Super Falcon - In 2005, Hawkes and adventurer Steve Fossett teamed up to create a submarine that could be piloted by an individual to the deepest part of the ocean. This spot in the Pacific Ocean, called Challenger Deep, is approximately under the ocean's surface and is thought to be the deepest point in the ocean. Together they began to develop the \"Challenger\" submersible with this goal in mind.

    "prompt": "Question: Is Welsh a dialect of English?\n\nContexts: [69894#82] Wales - The Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998 provide that the English and Welsh languages be treated on a basis of equality, and both are used as working languages within the National Assembly. Both English and Welsh are considered official languages of Wales, with Welsh further recognised in law as having \"official status\". English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. \"Wenglish\" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\". Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh is recognised to be a thing of the past.\n[33545#72] Welsh language - In fact, the differences between dialects of modern spoken Welsh pale into insignificance compared to the difference between some forms of the spoken language and the most formal constructions of the literary language. The latter is considerably more conservative and is the language used in Welsh translations of the Bible, amongst other things - although the 2004 () is significantly less formal than the traditional 1588 Bible. Gareth King, author of a popular Welsh grammar, observes that \"The difference between these two is much greater than between the virtually identical colloquial and literary forms of English\". A grammar of Literary Welsh can be found in \"A Grammar of Welsh\" by Stephen J. Williams or more completely in \"Gramadeg y Gymraeg\" by Peter Wynn Thomas. (No comprehensive grammar of formal literary Welsh exists in English.) An English-language guide to colloquial Welsh forms and register and dialect differences is by Ceri Jones.\n[24071801#0] Welsh English - Welsh English refers to the dialects of English spoken by Welsh people. The dialects are significantly influenced by Welsh grammar and often include words derived from Welsh. In addition to the distinctive words and grammar, a variety of accents are found across Wales, including those of north Wales, the Cardiff dialect, the South Wales Valleys and west Wales.\n[26179231#1] David Parry (dialectologist) - Parry is best known for establishing the Survey of Anglo-Welsh Dialects (SAWD) at Swansea University. He founded the SAWD in 1968 with the aim of recording the \"conservative forms\" of Welsh English spoken in rural locations in Wales using the same methodology as the Survey of English Dialects (1950-1961). The survey analysed pronunciation, lexis, morphology and syntax based on interviews with informants in ninety locations, who were to be over sixty years of age. The results of the survey for south-east and south-west Wales were published as two volumes in 1977 and 1979. To these a companion volume on north Wales was added in 1991. After his retirement in 1995, dialectologist Robert Penhallurick succeeded him as custodian of the SAWD Archive.\n[6248962#1] Welsh-Romani language - The majority of the vocabulary is of Indo-Aryan origin but there are a number of loanwords from other languages. Welsh loanwords include \"melanō\" (\"yellow\", from \"melyn\"), \"grīga\" (\"heather\", from \"grug\") and \"kraŋka\" (\"crab\", from \"cranc\"). There are also English loanwords such as \"vlija\" (\"village\"), \"spīdra\" (\"spider\") and \"bråmla\" (\"bramble\"). Historically the variants of Welsh and English Romani of the Romanichal, constituted the same variant of Romani, share characteristics and are historically closely related to dialects spoken in France, Germany (Sinti), Scandinavia, Spain, Poland, North Russia and the Baltic states. Such dialects are descended from the first wave of Romani immigrants into western, northern and southern Europe in the late Middle Ages.\n[25358536#15] Cardiff English - Like RP and a lot of other English dialects, Cardiff English is prone to constant assimilation and elision. It is the consistency and use of assimilation, even when speaking slowly, distinguishes CE from other English accents. It should also be noted that patterns found in other South Wales dialects are not found in Cardiff and instead is influenced by British accents.Many of the grammatical features below are influenced from south-western dialects of England, particularly sharing with the dialect of Reading. Non-standard forms when associated with Cardiff often have a negative reaction since most dialects in Wales are influenced by Welsh.\n[24071801#1] Welsh English - Accents and dialects in the west of Wales have been more heavily influenced by the Welsh language while dialects in the east have been influenced more by dialects in England. In the east and south east, it has been influenced by West Country and West Midland dialects while in north east Wales, it has been influenced by Merseyside English.Aside from lexical borrowings from Welsh like \"bach\" (little, wee), \"eisteddfod\", \"nain\" and \"taid\" (\"grandmother\" and \"grandfather\" respectively), there exist distinctive grammatical conventions in vernacular Welsh English. Examples of this include the use by some speakers of the tag question \"isn't it?\" regardless of the form of the preceding statement and the placement of the subject and the verb after the predicate for emphasis, e.g. \"Fed up, I am\" or \"Running on Friday, he is.\"\n[24071801#5] Welsh English - Spellings are almost identical to other dialects of British English. Minor differences occur with words descended from Welsh that are not anglicised unlike in many other dialects of English.\n[24071801#18] Welsh English - The influence of Welsh English can be seen in \"My People\" by Caradoc Evans, which uses it in dialogue (but not narrative); \"Under Milk Wood\" by Dylan Thomas, originally a radio play; and Niall Griffiths whose gritty realist pieces are mostly written in Welsh English.\nOther English dialects heavily influenced by Celtic languages\n[627143#7] Tywyn - The town's Welsh dialect has several notable features, with one Victorian observer stating that three languages were spoken there: English, Welsh and 'Tywynaeg'. During the 1860s, in the town's British School, a 'Welsh stick' (a version of the Welsh Not) was used to punish children who were caught speaking Welsh. Yet Welsh was the dominant language in Tywyn until the middle of the 20th century. Tywyn is now a very anglicised town, with the majority of its population (52.8%) having been born in England according to the 2011 census. Likewise, slightly more respondents claimed an English-only identity (35.0%) than a Welsh-only identity (33.7%).\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.58% of the population.\n[620333#6] Letterkenny - The modern town of Letterkenny began as a market town at the start of the 17th century, during the Plantation of Ulster. It may have been established on the site of an earlier Gaelic settlement. It was the first crossing point of the River Swilly. In the recent past, Letterkenny was a largely agricultural town, surrounded by extensive cattle and sheep grazing on what was then untilled hillside – at a time when Conwal (3 km west of Letterkenny) was the ecclesiastical and seaport centre. The waters of the Atlantic had not yet retreated from the basin of the Swilly, whose estuary at that time extended up almost as far as New Mills – proof of this may be found in those alluvial flat-lands between Oldtown and Port Road.\n[45576#2] County Donegal - In terms of size and area, it is the largest county in Ulster and the fourth-largest county in all of Ireland. Uniquely, County Donegal shares a small border with only one other county in the Republic of Ireland – County Leitrim. The greater part of its land border is shared with three counties of Northern Ireland: County Londonderry, County Tyrone and County Fermanagh. This geographic isolation from the rest of the Republic has led to Donegal people maintaining a distinct cultural identity and has been used to market the county with the slogan \"Up here it's different\". While Lifford is the county town, Letterkenny is by far the largest town in the county with a population of 19,588. Letterkenny and the nearby city of Derry form the main economic axis of the northwest of Ireland. Indeed, what became the City of Derry was officially part of County Donegal up until 1610.\n[620333#17] Letterkenny - The figures for ethnic and cultural background for people in the State in 2006 reveals that 16% of Letterkenny's population are non-nationals.

It lies on the River Swilly in East Donegal and has a population of 19,274. Along with the nearby city of Derry, Letterkenny is considered a regional economic gateway for the North-West of Ireland. Letterkenny acts as an urban gateway to the Ulster \"Gaeltacht\", similar to Galway's relationship to the Connemara \"Gaeltacht\".\n[620333#51] Letterkenny - Letterkenny has two GAA clubs: St. Eunan's GAA and Letterkenny Gaels, who play their home games at O'Donnell Park and at Páirc na nGael in The Glebe, respectively. St. Eunan's are considered one of Donegal's most successful and prolific clubs with major strides made with the clubs underage structure in recent years yielding various County and Ulster championships at underage level as well as considerable success at senior level since the turn of the century. Letterkenny Gaels were formed in 1996 but have yet to achieve much success and currently play in the Donegal junior championship. Almost uniquely in Ireland, Letterkenny Gaels, the GAA club, share facilities with Letterkenny Rugby Club. Gaelic football, like most of County Donegal, is the predominant sport, although soccer is also very popular.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

They were rediscovered with the advent of professional historiography in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when historians began to critically analyze primary sources to verify various claims. That necessitated the publication of primary sources. The first Lithuanian Chronicle, the Supraśl Manuscript, was published in 1823 by . In 1846, Teodor Narbutt published the Bychowiec Chronicle. Other historians published other manuscripts that they had found. In 1860s, the Archaeographic Commission became interested in collecting and publishing all known manuscripts of the Lithuanian Chronicles.

Schiller born?\n\nContexts: [53118524#0] Keith Schiller - Keith Schiller (born c. 1959) is a former Deputy Assistant to U.S. President Donald Trump who concurrently served as Director of Oval Office Operations. Prior to his appointment in the Trump administration, Schiller served as the Director of Security for The Trump Organization; in this capacity, he was the personal bodyguard to Trump. He has been described as \"one of Trump's most loyal and trusted aides\" and \"a constant presence at Trump's side for nearly two decades.\"\n[63742#1] Friedrich Schiller - Friedrich Schiller was born on 10 November 1759, in Marbach, Württemberg, as the only son of military doctor (1733–1796) and (1732–1802). They also had five daughters, including Christophine, the eldest. Schiller grew up in a very religious family and spent much of his youth studying the Bible, which would later influence his writing for the theatre. His father was away in the Seven Years' War when Friedrich was born. He was named after king Frederick the Great, but he was called Fritz by nearly everyone. Kaspar Schiller was rarely home during the war, but he did manage to visit the family once in a while. His wife and children also visited him occasionally wherever he happened to be stationed. When the war ended in 1763, Schiller's father became a recruiting officer and was stationed in Schwäbisch Gmünd. The family moved with him. Due to the high cost of living—especially the rent—the family moved to the nearby town of Lorch.\n[1795879#3] F. C. S. Schiller - Born in 1864, one of three brothers and the son of Ferdinand Schiller (a Calcutta merchant), Schiller's family home was in Switzerland. Schiller grew up in Rugby. He was educated at Rugby School and Balliol College, and graduated in the first class of \"Literae Humaniores\", winning later the Taylorian scholarship for German in 1887. Schiller's first book, \"Riddles of the Sphinx\" (1891), was an immediate success despite his use of a pseudonym because of his fears concerning how the book would be received. Between the years 1893 and 1897 he was an instructor in philosophy at Cornell University. In 1897 he returned to Oxford and became fellow and tutor of Corpus Christi for more than thirty years. Schiller was president of the Aristotelian Society in 1921, and was for many years treasurer of the Mind Association. In 1926 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. In 1929 he was appointed visiting professor in the University of Southern California, and spent half of each year in the United States and half in England. Schiller died in Los Angeles either 6, 7 or 9 August 1937 after a long and lingering illness.\n[1795879#34] F. C. S. Schiller - As early as 1891 Schiller had independently reached a doctrine very similar to William James' Will to Believe. As early as 1892 Schiller had independently developed his own pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's concern with meaning was one he entirely imports from the pragmatisms of James and Peirce. Later in life Schiller musters all of these elements of his pragmatism to make a concerted attack on formal logic. Concerned with bringing down the timeless, perfect worlds of abstract metaphysics early in life, the central target of Schiller's developed pragmatism is the abstract rules of formal logic. Statements, Schiller contends, cannot possess meaning or truth abstracted away from their actual use. Therefore, examining their formal features instead of their function in an actual situation is to make the same mistake the abstract metaphysician makes. Symbols are meaningless scratches on paper unless they are given a life in a situation, and meant by someone to accomplish some task. They are tools for dealing with concrete situations, and not the proper subjects of study themselves.\n[16653632#1] Bob Schiller - Schiller was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Lucille E. (Block) and Roland E. Schiller, a manufacturer. Schiller began writing for television in 1950. His credits include the 1955 CBS sitcom \"Professional Father\", starring Stephen Dunne as a child psychologist and Barbara Billingsley as his wife. That same year, he wrote for two competing series, NBC's \"The Jimmy Durante Show\" and CBS's \"It's Always Jan\", starring Janis Paige as a widowed single mother in New York City. During 1954–1955, Schiller was one of the writers for \"That's My Boy\", starring Eddie Mayehoff and Gil Stratton. Schiller's producing credits include \"The Good Guys\" and \"All's Fair\".\n[1795879#27] F. C. S. Schiller - While Schiller's will to believe is a central theme of \"Riddle of the Sphinx\" (appearing mainly in the introduction and conclusion of his text), in 1891 the doctrine held a limited role in Schiller's philosophy. In \"Riddles\", Schiller only employs his version of the will to believe doctrine when he is faced with overcoming sceptic and pessimistic methods of philosophy. In 1897, William James published his essay \"The Will to Believe\" and this influenced Schiller to drastically expanded his application of the doctrine. For a 1903 volume titled \"Personal Idealism\", Schiller contributed a widely read essay titled \"Axioms as Postulates\" in which he sets out to justify the \"axioms of logic\" as postulates adopted on the basis of the will to believe doctrine. In this essay Schiller extends the will to believe doctrine to be the basis of our acceptance of causality, of the uniformity of nature, of our concept of identity, of contradiction, of the law of excluded middle, of space and time, of the goodness of God, and more. He notes that we postulate that nature is uniform because we \"need\" nature to be uniform:\n[6643113#1] Margrit Schiller - Schiller was born in Bonn, North Rhine-Westphalia in March 1948. She studied psychology in Bonn and Heidelberg and became a student member of the Socialist Patients' Collective (SPK) and was one of the members who turned militant in 1970. After the SPK dissolved Schiller joined the Red Army Faction.\n[1795879#0] F. C. S. Schiller - Ferdinand Canning Scott Schiller (16 August 1864 – 6 August 1937), usually cited as F. C. S. Schiller, was a German-British philosopher. Born in Altona, Holstein (at that time member of the German Confederation, but under Danish administration), Schiller studied at the University of Oxford, later was a professor there, after being invited back after a brief time at Cornell University. Later in his life he taught at the University of Southern California. In his lifetime he was well known as a philosopher; after his death his work was largely forgotten.\n[30884993#1] Walter Schiller - Dr. Walter Schiller was born in Vienna in 1887, the only child of Friedrich and Emma Schiller, who were of Jewish descent. He studied in Vienna, working as a demonstrator of physiology under Sigmund Exner and pathology under Anton Weichselbaum. He received his doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1912, and worked as a bacteriologist in the Bulgarian Army during the First Balkan War in the same year. He trained in pathology under Weichselbaum, and was a \"Medizinaloffizier\" in charge of a medical laboratory in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, serving in Bosnia, Russia, Turkey and Palestine.\n[1795879#5] F. C. S. Schiller - In 1891, F.C.S. Schiller made his first contribution to philosophy anonymously. Schiller feared that in his time of high naturalism, the metaphysical speculations of his \"Riddles of the Sphinx\" were likely to hurt his professional prospects (p. xi, \"Riddles\"). However, Schiller's fear of reprisal from his anti-metaphysical colleagues should not suggest that Schiller was a friend of metaphysics. Like his fellow pragmatists across the ocean, Schiller was attempting to stake out an intermediate position between both the spartan landscape of naturalism and the speculative excesses of the metaphysics of his time. In \"Riddles\" Schiller both, \nThe result, Schiller contends, is that naturalism cannot make sense of the \"higher\" aspects of our world (freewill, consciousness, God, purpose, universals), while abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the \"lower\" aspects of our world (the imperfect, change, physicality). In each case we are unable to guide our moral and epistemological \"lower\" lives to the achievement of life's \"higher\" ends, ultimately leading to scepticism on both fronts. For knowledge and morality to be possible, both the world's lower and higher elements must be real; e.g. we need universals (a higher) to make knowledge of particulars (a lower) possible. This would lead Schiller to argue for what he at the time called a \"concrete metaphysics\", but would later call \"humanism\".\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What flightless birds live in New Zealand?\n\nContexts: [927476#6] Flightless bird - New Zealand had more species of flightless birds (including the kiwi, several species of penguins, the takahe, the weka, the moa, and several other extinct species) than any other such location. One reason is that until the arrival of humans roughly a thousand years ago, there were no large land predators in New Zealand; the main predators of flightless birds were larger birds.\n[22621#45] Oceania - The birds of New Zealand evolved into an avifauna that included a large number of endemic species. As an island archipelago New Zealand accumulated bird diversity and when Captain James Cook arrived in the 1770s he noted that the bird song was deafening. The mix includes species with unusual biology such as the kakapo which is the world's only flightless, nocturnal, lek breeding parrot, but also many species that are similar to neighboring land areas. Some of the more well known and distinctive bird species in New Zealand are the kiwi, kea, takahe, kakapo, mohua, tui and the bellbird. The tuatara is a notable reptile endemic to New Zealand.\n[206915#1] New Zealand wren - New Zealand wrens are mostly insectivorous foragers of New Zealand’s forests, with one species, the New Zealand rock wren, being restricted to alpine areas. Both the remaining species are poor fliers and four of the five extinct species are known to be, or are suspected of having been, flightless (based on observations of living birds and the size of their sterna); along with the long-legged bunting from Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands, they are the only passerines known to have lost the ability to fly. Of the species for which the plumage is known, they are drab-coloured birds with brown-green plumage. They form monogamous pair bonds to raise their young, laying their eggs in small nests in trees or amongst rocks. They are diurnal and like all New Zealand passerines, for the most part, are sedentary.\n[25247708#3] Stoats in New Zealand - New Zealand has a high proportion of ground-nesting and flightless birds, due to its long geographical isolation and a lack of mammal predators. Native birds have evolved to fill niches that are occupied by mammals in most other places. Stoats are the greatest threat to these ground-nesting and hole-nesting birds, which have very limited means of escaping stoat predation. In some areas the whio population is now 70% male, from stoats attacking female ducks incubating eggs.\n[26731341#3] Nelson Coast temperate forest - The forests are home to a number of endemic species including two flightless birds that no longer survive in the lowland areas of the island, these are the western weka and the largest kiwi, the great spotted kiwi. The varied habitats in the region support a mixture of other birds found here include the kea, the New Zealand kaka parrot\" (Nestor meridionalis)\", the New Zealand pigeon or kereru \"(Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae)\" and the New Zealand falcon or karearea \"(Falco novaeseelandiae)\". Farewell Spit in particular is an important site for wading birds and is on a migration route. \nThe area is also rich in invertebrates including almost half of the known species of amber snails \"(Powelliphanta)\".\n[23878#15] Penguin - The basal penguins lived around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event somewhere in the general area of (southern) New Zealand and Byrd Land, Antarctica. Due to plate tectonics, these areas were at that time less than apart rather than the of today. The most recent common ancestor of penguins and their sister clade can be roughly dated to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, around 70–68 mya.\nWhat can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that, by the end of the Cretaceous, the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so morphologically; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of trophic webs that follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities (\"see also\" Flightless cormorant).\n[17362#0] Kiwi - Kiwi ( ) or kiwis are flightless birds native to New Zealand, in the genus Apteryx and family Apterygidae. Approximately the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far the smallest living ratites (which also consist of ostriches, emus, rheas, and cassowaries), and lay the largest egg in relation to their body size of any species of bird in the world.\n[14714476#0] Saint Bathans mammal - The Saint Bathans mammal is a currently unnamed extinct primitive mammal from the Miocene of New Zealand. A member of the Saint Bathans Fauna, it is notable for being a late surviving \"archaic\" mammal species, neither a placental or a marsupial, as well as for providing evidence that flightless fully terrestrial mammals did in fact once live in Zealandia, in contrast with modern New Zealand, where bats and pinnipeds are the only non introduced mammals in the otherwise bird-dominated terrestrial faunas.\n[21354690#0] Broad-billed moa - The broad-billed, stout-legged moa or coastal moa (\"Euryapteryx curtus\") is an extinct species of moa. These moa lived in both the North and the South Islands of New Zealand, and on Stewart Island. Its habitat was in the lowlands (dunelands, forests, shrublands, and grasslands). It was a ratite and a member of the Struthioniformes Order. The Struthioniformes are flightless birds with a sternum without a keel. They also have a distinctive palate. The origin of these birds is becoming clearer as it is now believed that early ancestors of these birds were able to fly and flew to the southern areas that they have been found in.\n[206928#6] List of birds of New Zealand - The penguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid, and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What does a project manager do?\n\nContexts: [31427966#0] Site manager - In the construction industry, site managers, often referred to as construction managers, site agents or building managers, are responsible for the day-to-day on site running of a construction project. Site managers are required to keep within the timescale and budget of a project, and manage any delays or problems encountered on-site during a construction project. Also involved in the role is the managing of quality control, health and safety checks and the inspection of work carried out. Many site managers will be involved before site activity takes place, and are responsible for managing communications between all parties involved in the on-site development of the project. Site managers are often required to deal with inquiries and communication with the public. Typically a site manager is employed by a construction company, contractor or civil engineering firm but they are often employed by local authorities to oversee the refurbishment of council owned properties.\n[11978909#0] Program designer - A program designer is the person responsible for the overall design of an internet or interactive project. Relying on a broad base of visual, media and computing skills, the program designer shapes the project's look and functionality from initial stages to completed project. Unlike the project manager, who has broad budget and scheduling responsibility, the program designer oversees the artistic and functional direction, and therefore relays plans and specifications to the visual designers, interface designers, developers and project manager in order to construct the program. Similar to an information architect, the program designer does not necessarily dwell in the domain of information per se, but also may venture into instructional design, application design, and the overall design direction of those types of projects.\n[282626#7] Program management - According to the view that programs deliver outcomes but projects deliver outputs, program management is concerned with doing the right projects. The program manager has been described as 'playing chess' and keeping the overview in mind, with the pieces to be used or sacrificed being the projects. In contrast, project management is about doing projects right. And also according to this view, successful projects deliver on time, to budget and to specification, whereas successful programs deliver long term improvements to an organization. Improvements are usually identified through benefits. An organization should select the group of programs that most take it towards its strategic aims while remaining within its capacity to deliver the changes. On the other hand, the view that programs are simply large projects or a set of projects allows that a program may need to deliver tangible benefits quickly.\n[43571244#13] Corporate and Project Management Research Institute - – Expert Council on project management\n– Expert Council on communications systems\n– Expert Council on price formation in the construction\n– Expert Council on investments\n– Expert Council on the development of relations with China and other countries of the East\n– Expert Council on innovations\n– Expert Council on PPP projects’ management\n– Expert Council on payment systems\n[27317123#11] The Anti-Politics Machine - Ferguson wrote that it is not enough to note development's failures; even the project managers initially recognized it as a failure. If that was all Ferguson had done, his book would not have had the influence it did. Asking if development is a failure is asking the wrong question; it ignores the \"instrument effects\" of what the projects DO do. In other words, we should ask what NON-economic functions does development serve? His answer:\n[239050#0] Project manager - A project manager is a professional in the field of project management. Project managers have the responsibility of the planning, procurement and execution of a project, in any undertaking that has a defined scope, defined start and a defined finish; regardless of industry. Project managers are first point of contact for any issues or discrepancies arising from within the heads of various departments in an organization before the problem escalates to higher authorities. Project management is the responsibility of a project manager. This individual seldom participates directly in the activities that produce the end result, but rather strives to maintain the progress, mutual interaction and tasks of various parties in such a way that reduces the risk of overall failure, maximizes benefits, and minimizes costs.\n[52251534#0] Old Appleton Bridge - Old Appleton Bridge is a historic Pratt Truss Iron Bridge located at Old Appleton, Cape Girardeau County and Perry County, Missouri. It was built in 1879, and consists of a wrought iron, pin-connected, Pratt through truss main span, with two pin-connected, three panel Pratt pony-truss approach spans. It rests on limestone block masonry piers. The total length of the bridge is .\n[1077741#2] Project architect - The project architect can also assume the role of the project manager (PM) in a small studio, but typically, the project architect is only responsible for the design management of a building project, assisted by interns and other staff. A project architect is required to be registered as an architect in the state in which they are performing the role. Intern architects may perform the role under the supervision of a registered architect but may not sign or seal legal documents. The project architect may, but does not often, sign contracts, or seal construction documents or payment applications, which are most often legally signed and sealed by a state registered owner or partner of the architectural office. This liability is covered by the firm, and the legal responsibility for any architectural design errors and omissions ultimately falls on the registered architect, the owner or partner in an architectural firm who signs the documents.\n[19477084#6] Tensta Konsthall - Recent exhibitions at Tensta konsthall include\n• “Abstract Possible: The Stockholm Synergies,” with Doug Ashford, Claire Barclay, Goldin+Senneby, Wade Guyton, Mai-Thu Perret, Walid Raad, and Haegue Yang, among others\n• “Kami, Khokha, Bert and Ernie: World Heritage” by Hinrich Sachs\n• “Doing what you want: Marie-Louise Ekman accompanied by Sister Corita Kent, Mladen Stilinović, and Martha Wilson” \n• “The Society without qualities” with Sören Andreasen, Ane Hjort Guttu, Sture Johannesson, Sharon Lockhardt, and Palle Nielsen (part of “The new model” and curated by Lars Bang Larsen)\n• “Working With…” by Zak Kyes\n• “We are continuing BBDG” with Bernd Krauss\n• “Two Archives” by Babak Afrassiabi and Nasrin Tabatabai\n[33148906#18] Anthropology of development - Ferguson writes that it is not enough to note development's failures; even the project managers initially recognized it as a failure.

Over the years, he opened shops in the New York City area selling butter and eggs. Following World War II, Daitch Crystal Dairies enjoyed tremendous growth in the new supermarket format, emerging in the 1950s as a significant chain. In 1955, Daitch and its 34 stores (in New York City, Nassau and Suffolk counties, and in Connecticut, merged with Shopwell Foods' chain of 18 Westchester County supermarkets. Shopwell was founded by Sigmund Rosengarten, who entered the supermarket business as a butcher. The supermarket chain (known under variations of the Daitch and Shopwell names) underwent a period of significant expansion. Within a year, seven new stores were opened and nine more were added by acquiring the Diamond K chain.\n[13071291#5] Canyon Creek, Austin, Texas - Canyon Creek has nearby private schools:\nNearby religious institutions include:Lakeline Mall is less than four miles away, and three large grocery supermarkets (HEB, HEB-Plus, and Wal-Mart) are within two miles.

After 1985 the company expanded rapidly through both organic growth and a number of acquisitions and takeovers. Atlantic was a public company and its shares used to trade in the Athens Stock Exchange from 2000 up to 2010. As of 2006–2007, the company had 182 stores nationwide and was the fifth largest supermarket chain in Greece as measured by market share. The company had also operated a franchise network of smaller stores branded \"ARISTA\". Since 2009 the company had suffered from serious financial difficulties (mainly due to excessive borrowing) and eventually (in 2011) went into liquidation. The company ceased all trading as of 3 August 2011.\n[52961994#3] EuroShop - EuroShop debuted from 11 to 15 June 1966 on the old exhibition grounds in the Ehrenhof. A total of 331 exhibitors from 55 countries took advantage of the new platform to present their products. The some 29,000 trade visitors who attended primarily sought information on shop fitting, the dominant subject of the initial events. The fair was held in conjunction with a congress for ‘modern shops and display windows’. EuroShop was founded in response to fundamental changes in retail trade. From the mid-1960s, self-service concepts became increasingly prevalent, especially in the food retail industry. Simultaneously, the first discount supermarkets, introducing new retail concepts, emerged as competitors to the traditionally brand-oriented supermarkets. To heighten their own profile, merchants were increasingly compelled to turn to new measures, especially in the area of shop fitting.\n[18691665#19] Sanaʽa - Sanaʽa was chosen as the 2004 Arab Cultural Capital by the Arab League.

The Yarlung Tsangpo (Tibetan name for the upper course of the Brahmaputra) originates near Mount Kailash and runs east for about 1700 km, draining a northern section of the Himalayas before it enters the gorge just downstream of Pei, Tibet near the settlement of Zhibe. The canyon has a length of about 240 km (150 miles) as the gorge bends around Mount Namcha Barwa (7782 m) and cuts its way through the eastern Himalayan range. Its waters drop from about 2,900 m near Pei to about 1,500 m at the end of the Upper Gorge where the Po Tsangpo River enters. The river continues through the Lower Gorge to the Indian border at an elevation of 660 m. The river then enters Arunachal Pradesh and eventually becomes the Brahmaputra.\n[78478#9] Canyon - The Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon (or Tsangpo Canyon), along the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, is regarded by some as the deepest canyon in the world at 5,500 m (18,000 ft).

The Gators and Vols have competed in the same athletic conference since Florida joined the now-defunct Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1910, and the schools were founding members of the Southeastern Conference in 1932. Despite this long conference association, a true rivalry did not develop until the early 1990s due to the infrequency of earlier meetings; in the first seventy-six years (1916–91) of the series, the two teams met just twenty-one times. The Southeastern Conference (SEC) expanded to twelve universities and split into two divisions in 1992. Florida and Tennessee were placed in the SEC's East Division and have met on a home-and-home basis every season since. Their rivalry quickly blossomed in intensity and importance in the 1990s and early 2000s as both programs regularly fielded national championship contending teams under coaches Phil Fulmer of Tennessee and Steve Spurrier at Florida.\n[38044784#6] Texas–Texas A&amp;M football rivalry - In October 2006, General Mills announced they would honor the then third-longest running college football rivalry with a special edition Wheaties box. The box featured the helmets of Texas and Texas A&M and their respective home stadiums, Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium and Kyle Field, on either side. Although several individual college basketball and football teams had been featured previously on special edition boxes, this was the first time Wheaties had honored a rivalry series.\n[12359424#5] Florida–Tennessee football rivalry - Florida and Tennessee have played on the third Saturday of September almost every year since 1992, giving the rivalry its nickname. Notable exceptions were in 2001, when the game was postponed until December 1 due to the September 11 terrorist attacks, and in 2014, when the addition of two new members to the SEC temporarily scrambled the dates of many traditional conference rivalries and moved the Florida–Tennessee game to October. The rivalry has sometimes served as the conference opener and is often the first significant test of the season for one or both of the teams.\n[2964340#0] Third Saturday in October - The Third Saturday in October is the Alabama–Tennessee football rivalry. It is an American college football rivalry game played annually by the Crimson Tide of the University of Alabama and the Volunteers of the University of Tennessee. The respective campuses are located approximately apart. It is known as the Third Saturday in October because the game was traditionally played on it prior to the 1992 football season, when the Southeastern Conference (SEC) split into its Eastern and Western divisions. From 1995 to 2015, it was only scheduled for that date six times, though it was scheduled for that date in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Alabama leads the series 57–37–8 .\n[965011#10] Tennessee Volunteers - Tennessee competes in the SEC's Eastern Division, along with Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina, and Vanderbilt, and has longstanding football rivalries with the majority of them. However, the Vols' most intense and bitter traditional rivalry is with the Alabama Crimson Tide. The teams battle every year in the Third Saturday in October, though the game is now usually held on the fourth Saturday in October. The Vols' Super Bowl champions Peyton Manning and Reggie White are among the most famous NFL athletes to start their careers at the University of Tennessee. Todd Helton also played football, in addition to baseball, as a quarterback.\n[7751357#19] Alabama Crimson Tide football - Despite the heated in-state rivalry with Auburn, Bear Bryant was more adamant about defeating his rivals to the north, the Tennessee Volunteers. The series is named the Third Saturday in October, the traditional calendar date on which the game was played. Despite the name, the game has only been played on the third Saturday five times between 1995–2007. The first game between the two sides was played in 1901 in Birmingham, ending in a 6–6 tie. From 1902 to 1913, Alabama dominated the series, only losing once, and never allowing a touchdown by the Volunteers. Beginning in 1928, the rivalry was first played on its traditional date and began to be a challenge for the Crimson Tide as Robert Neyland began challenging Alabama for their perennial spot on top of the conference standings. In the 1950s, Jim Goostree, the head trainer for Alabama, began another tradition as he began handing out cigars following a victory over the Volunteers.\n[34908478#4] Boston College–UMass football rivalry - In April 2011, UMass announced plans to join the Mid-American Conference and move up to the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision, the highest level of college football in the country. Boston College had been a member of this division for decades, and there was much speculation that the two schools may cultivate a renewal of the rivalry. This was confirmed when it was reported in September, 2011, that they had agreed to play a three-game biannual series beginning in 2014. Two of the games will be played at BC's Alumni Stadium, while the other was played at Gillette Stadium, the Minutemen's home field on August, 2014.\n[59556618#8] 2019 Alabama Crimson Tide football team - Alabama announced its 2019 football schedule on September 18, 2018. The 2019 Crimson Tide' schedule consists of 7 home and 4 away games for the regular season. Alabama will host four SEC conference opponents Ole Miss (Rivalry), Arkansas, Tennessee (Third Saturday of October) and LSU (Rivalry) and will travel for four SEC opponents to South Carolina, Texas A&M, Mississippi State (Rivalry) and arch-rival Auburn for the 126th annual Iron Bowl to close out the SEC regular season on the road. Alabama is not scheduled to play SEC East opponents Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri and Vanderbilt in the 2019 regular season. The Crimson Tide’s bye week comes during week 6 (on October 5) and week 10 (on November 2).\n[5683868#3] Deep South's Oldest Rivalry - The game played on December 2, 2017 was the 2017 SEC Championship Game, and was the second time the Tigers and Bulldogs meet in the 2017 season.\nSeries record sources: \"2011 Auburn Football Media Guide\", \"2011 Georgia Football Media Guide\", College Football Data Warehouse,\nIn 1892, The two schools met in the first meeting in what is now the Deep South’s oldest college football rivalry. Auburn won the game 10–0. One Atlanta newspaper called it the “social event of the year.”\n[7357018#25] Tennessee Volunteers football - Despite the heated in-state rivalry with Auburn, former Alabama head coach Bear Bryant was more adamant about defeating his rivals to the north, the Tennessee Vols. The series is named the Third Saturday in October, the traditional calendar date on which the game was played. Despite the name, the game was played on the third Saturday just five times between 1995 and 2007. The first game between the two sides was played in 1901 in Birmingham, ending in a 6–6 tie. From 1902 to 1913, Alabama dominated the series, only losing once, and never allowing a touchdown by the Volunteers.

In that project, he and his team studied a Mexican-American population with major depressive disorder in the city of Los Angeles, in the context of an extensive process of community engagement, which received Certificates of Commendation both from the California State Legislature and the United States Congress. He contributed the Mexican-American samples to the International HapMap Project. His pharmacogenetics research has resulted in several publications on predictors of antidepressant treatment response in this population.\n[43496955#7] Julio Jorge Nelson - Julio went every day to see his parents, where his son lived. His son went to the same school that Julio attended: Francisco de Victoria, at 240 Julián Álvarez. His son would visit him at Radio Mitre, at 1925 Arenales 1925, and even lived for a time with his father. But one day, at age 14, his son escaped from the grandparents' house, leaving a letter in which he explained to them that he was going south. The truth was that he was going to Guayaquil Ecuador with two friends. In Bolivia they were arrested, but managed to continue traveling on a group passport. At his destination, Julio's son found employment at Club Barcelona. At that time, Tucho Méndez, a friendof Julio's and aware of the disappearance of Julio's child, recognized his son with great surprise. He immediately phoned Buenos Aires, and shortly after, via a link to a radio Guayaquil, Julio, who had never shown her affection for his son asked the son to come back home. And his son did return.\n[50344659#7] Julio Xavier Labayen - Despite the usual attraction to the opposite sex during his youth, Julio Jr. felt called towards religious life. After high school, the young man approached his mother to ask permission to pursue this longing to be a priest. But his mother did not allow him, thinking that it was just a surge of emotions. She asked him to take first a two-year college program so that he could think and assess himself more. Julio Sr. wanted a doctor in his family - as such his son would pursue a pre-medicine course at the Colegio de San Agustin de Iloilo. There he would play for the school's basketball team and would herald a no-defeat record with his team.\n[40923401#11] Julio Licinio - Licinio conceptualised, obtained funding for, and directed three graduate training programs with master's degrees in translational investigation, for physician-scientists, at UCLA (supported by an NIH K30 award), University of Miami (supported by an NIH K30 award), and Australian National University. He also created and obtained NIH T32, NIH K12, and PhRMA Foundation (2004 Center of Excellence in Clinical Pharmacology) funding for the UCLA Interdepartmental Clinical Pharmacology Training Program, of which he was founding director (1999–2006). Licinio was the recipient of an NIH K24 award to mentor early career physician-scientists (2002–2007).\n[41959688#0] Winfield Toll Bridge - Winfield Toll Bridge, also known as the Ross Booth Memorial Bridge, is a historic three-span cantilever Warren Truss bridge located at Winfield and Red House, Putnam County, West Virginia. It was built in 1955, and spans the Kanawha River, carrying West Virginia Route 34. The cantilever through-truss consists of two anchor spans each 245 feet in length and the main span 462 feet in length between pier center lines. The main span consists of two 128 feet, 4 inch, cantilever arms and a 205 feet, 4 inch, suspended span.\n[1493413#2] Peter Levi - He was educated in private Catholic establishments starting at Prior Park near Bath, run by the Christian Brothers. When he was 14, Oscar Wilde had become his literary idol. Wilde had said that \"the Greek text of the Gospels was the most beautiful book in the world\", so a school with more Greek was demanded and he changed schools to Beaumont College, a Jesuit school in Old Windsor, Berkshire. While at Beaumont, at the age of 17 he joined the Society of Jesus as a novice. He was to remain a Jesuit until he resigned the priesthood 29 years later in 1977. Levi trained for the priesthood at Heythrop College and read Classics at Campion Hall. During his teenage years he suffered from polio and as an undergraduate was knocked down by a car – the after-effects of these were to affect him throughout his life.\nWhilst at Heythrop, then a country house near Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, he was not the most ruly of seminarians. This and possible doubts about his vocation led to his ordination being delayed for a year:\n[7016212#4] Julio Le Parc - Julio Le Parc found an interest in art at the age of thirteen when it was evident that, while he was a mediocre student, he was exceptional at sketching portraits and illustration cards. His environment, mainly being the School of Fine Arts significantly influenced the early part of his career. While there he attended night classes while working full-time. Le Parc took a special interest in the avant-garde artistic movements in Argentina: Movement of Arte Concreto Invencion. After attending the School for four and a half years he decided to leave the school and the area. He decides to go travel the country, not speaking to his family for eight years. He later returns to the Academy of Fine Arts, where he takes an active role in student movement groups. Julio Le Parc graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts with Luis Wells and Rogelio Polesello. After returning, in 1958 Le Parc received a grant from the French Cultural Service to go to Paris, France. Much of his early career was committed to painting, engraving and creating monotypes. However, in 1959 Le Parc begins his experimentation with image produced by light multiplied by layers of planes of Plexiglas. Le Parc participated in his first exhibition, Bienal de Sáo Paulo in Sáo Paulo, Brazil in 1957.\n[40923401#0] Julio Licinio - Julio Licinio is currently Senior Vice President for Academic and Health Affairs, as well as Executive Dean, Dean of the College of Medicine, and Professor in Departments of Psychiatry, Pharmacology, and Medicine at State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York.

    "prompt": "Question: Where did the Celtiberians live?\n\nContexts: [461337#13] Celtiberians - The Celtiberian presence remains on the map of Spain in hundreds of Celtic place-names. The archaeological recovery of Celtiberian culture commenced with the excavations of Numantia, published between 1914 and 1931.\n[461337#7] Celtiberians - Excavations at the Celtiberian strongholds \"Kontebakom-Bel\" Botorrita, \"Sekaisa\" Segeda, Tiermes complement the grave goods found in Celtiberian cemeteries, where aristocratic tombs of the 6th to 5th centuries BC give way to warrior tombs with a tendency from the 3rd century BC for weapons to disappear from grave goods, either indicating an increased urgency for their distribution among living fighters or, as Almagro-Gorbea and Lorrio think, the increased urbanization of Celtiberian society. Many late Celtiberian \"oppida\" are still occupied by modern towns, inhibiting archaeology.\n[6878247#14] Celtiberian Wars - Appian wrote that this war broke out because Segeda (near Zaragoza), a powerful city of the Celtiberian tribe of the Belli, persuaded the people of some smaller towns to settle there and was building a circuit of walls seven kilometres long. It also forced the neighbouring Titti to join in. The Belli had agreed to the treaties Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus had made with tribes in Hispania at the end of the First Celtiberian War. Rome considered that Segeda was breaking the treaty. It forbade the building of the wall, demanded the tribute and the provision of a contingent for the Roman army in accordance with the stipulations of Gracchus' treaty. The Segedans replied that the treaty forbade the construction of new towns, but did not forbid the fortification existing ones. They also said that they had been subsequently released from the tribute and the military contingent by the Romans. This was true, but the senate argued that when it granted such exemptions it always specified that they were to continue only during its pleasure. The senate must have decided to withdraw the exemptions because it was worried about the development of Segeda into a powerful city in the land of the Celtiberians, who had a history of rebellions. Rome prepared for war.\n[461337#0] Celtiberians - The Celtiberians were a group of Celts or Celticized peoples inhabiting the central-eastern Iberian Peninsula during the final centuries BC. They were explicitly mentioned as being Celts by several classic authors (e.g. Strabo). These tribes spoke the Celtiberian language and wrote it by adapting the Iberian alphabet. The numerous inscriptions that have been discovered, some of them extensive, have allowed scholars to classify the Celtiberian language as a Celtic language, possibly one of the Hispano-Celtic (also known as Iberian Celtic) languages that were spoken in pre-Roman and early Roman Iberia. Archaeologically, many elements link Celtiberians with Celts in Central Europe, but also show large differences with both the Hallstatt culture and La Tène culture.\n[6906551#0] First Celtiberian War - The First Celtiberian (181-179 BC) was the first of three major rebellions by the Celtiberians against the Roman presence in Hispania. The other two were the Second Celtiberian War (154-151 BC) and the Numantine War (143-133 BC). Hispania was the name the Romans gave to the Iberian Peninsula. The peninsula was inhabited by various ethnic groups and numerous tribes. The Celtiberians were a confederation of five tribes which lived in a large area of east central Hispania, to the west of Hispania Citerior. The eastern part of their territory shared a stretch of the border of this Roman province. The Celtiberian tribes were the Pellendones, the Arevaci, the Lusones, the Titti and the Belli.\n[461337#6] Celtiberians - The cultural stronghold of Celtiberians was the northern area of the central \"meseta\" in the upper valleys of the Tagus and Douro east to the \"Iberus\" (Ebro) river, in the modern provinces of Soria, Guadalajara, Zaragoza and Teruel. There, when Greek and Roman geographers and historians encountered them, the established Celtiberians were controlled by a military aristocracy that had become a hereditary elite. The dominant tribe were the Arevaci, who dominated their neighbors from powerful strongholds at Okilis (Medinaceli) and who rallied the long Celtiberian resistance to Rome. Other Celtiberians were the Belli and Titti in the Jalón valley, and the Lusones to the east.\n[1458751#3] Celtiberian script - The Celtiberian inscriptions have been found mainly in the Ebro valley and near the sources of the Tagus and Douro rivers, where Roman and Greek sources place the Celtiberian people. The Celtiberian inscriptions were made on different types of objects (silver and bronze coins, ceramic receptacles, bronze plaques and tesseras, amphores, stones, spindle-whorls, etc.). There are just under two hundred surviving inscriptions, one of which is exceptionally long: the third Botorrita bronze plaque (Zaragoza) with more than three thousand signs containing a census of nearly 250 people. Almost always the direction of the writing is left to right. The fact that nearly all the Celtiberian inscriptions were found out of archaeological context does not allow a precise chronology to be established, but it seems that the earliest inscriptions in the Celtiberian script date from the 2nd century BCE while the latest ones date from the 1st century BCE.\n[6480414#1] Second Celtiberian War - In 154 BC, the Roman senate objected to the Belli town of Segeda building a circuit of walls, and declared war. At least three tribes of Celtiberians were involved in the war: the Titti, the Belli (towns of Segeda and Nertobriga) and the Averaci (towns of Numantia, Axinum and Ocilis). After some initial Celtiberian victories, the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus inflicted some defeats and made peace with the Celtiberians. The next consul, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, attacked the Vaccaei, a tribe living in the central Duero valley which was not at war with Rome. He did so without the authorisation of the senate, with the excuse that the Vaccaei had mistreated the Carpetani. The Second Celtiberian War overlapped with the Lusitanian War of 155–150 BC.\n[6878247#2] Celtiberian Wars - In 154 BC, the Roman senate objected to the Belli town of Segeda building a circuit of walls, and declared war. Thus, the Second Celtiberian War (154–152 BC) started. At least three tribes of Celtiberians were involved in the war: the Titti, the Belli (towns of Segeda and Nertobriga) and the Arevaci (towns of Numantia, Axinum and Ocilis). After some initial Celtiberian victories, the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus inflicted some defeats and made peace with the Celtiberians. The next consul, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, attacked the Vaccaei, a tribe living in the central Duero valley which was not at war with Rome. He did so without the authorisation of the senate, with the excuse that the Vaccaei had mistreated the Carpetani. The Second Celtiberian War overlapped with the Lusitanian War of (154–150 BC).\n[1405133#0] Celtiberian language - Celtiberian or Northeastern Hispano-Celtic is an extinct Indo-European language of the Celtic branch spoken by the Celtiberians in an area of the Iberian Peninsula lying between the headwaters of the Douro, Tagus, Júcar and Turia rivers and the Ebro river. This language is directly attested in nearly 200 inscriptions dated to the 2nd century BC and the 1st century BC, mainly in Celtiberian script, a direct adaptation of the northeastern Iberian script, but also in Latin alphabet. The longest extant Celtiberian inscriptions are those on three Botorrita plaques, bronze plaques from Botorrita near Zaragoza, dating to the early 1st century BC, labelled Botorrita I, III and IV (Botorrita II is in the Latin language). In the northwest was another Celtic language, Gallaecian (also known as Northwestern Hispano-Celtic), that was closely related to Celtiberian.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Where did Jehovah's Witnesses originate?\n\nContexts: [25074#92] Persecution of Christians - Outside mainstream Christianity, the Jehovah's Witnesses were targets of Nazi Persecution, for their refusal to swear allegiance to the Nazi government. In Nazi Germany in the 1930s and early 1940s, Jehovah's Witnesses refused to renounce their political neutrality and they were placed in concentration camps as a result. The Nazi government gave detained Jehovah's Witnesses the option of release if they signed a document which indicated their renouncement of their faith, their submission to state authority, and their support of the German military. Historian Hans Hesse said, \"Some five thousand Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps where they alone were 'voluntary prisoners', so termed because the moment they recanted their views, they could be freed. Some lost their lives in the camps, but few renounced their faith\".\n[16143902#32] Freedom of religion in Kazakhstan - In March 2007 Jehovah's Witness centers throughout the country rented local halls and rooms for an April 2, 2007, religious ceremony, and distributed fliers inviting citizens to the event. However, in several cities, including Kyzylorda, Shaktinsk, Shymkent, and Taraz, the landlords called the Jehovah's Witnesses shortly before the event and canceled the reservation. The Jehovah's Witnesses alleged that the landlords were pressured by local government officials. In Semipalatinsk, the Jehovah's Witnesses and their guests arrived on April 2 to find their rented space surrounded by firefighters. A local government representative claimed that they needed a permit for the ceremony and denied them admission to their rented room. In each case, the Jehovah's Witnesses were able to hold their ceremony in other locations. No other religious groups reported similar instances of government interference in their public gatherings.\n[13949533#21] Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany - From 1935, the authorities began sending hundreds of Jehovah's Witnesses to concentration camps, where they were imprisoned with Communists, Socialists, other political prisoners and union members. In May 1938, they accounted for 12 percent of all prisoners at Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar; by May 1939, they represented 40 percent of all prisoners at Schloss Lichentenburg, the central concentration camp for women, though as the total number of prisoners increased rapidly, the proportion of Witnesses generally fell to about 3 percent. About 2000 Witnesses were eventually sent to Nazi concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles; as many as 1200 died in custody, including 250 who were executed. Garbe claims members of the group were special objects of hatred by the SS, receiving beatings, whippings and public humiliation and given the dirtiest and most laborious work details for refusing to salute, stand at attention or sing Nazi songs. They were subjected to high-pressure jets of ice-cold water from fire hydrants and subjected to arbitrary acts of torture, including pushing a fully laden wheelbarrow with their necks while crawling on hands and knees. Others were forced to stand still for an entire day in the heat or cold, or were confined in groups in small closets in an attempt to suffocate them. From March to December 1938, Jehovah's Witnesses in Buchenwald were not allowed to send or receive letters or to purchase food. Many approached starvation and were forced to eat leaves from trees and bushes. Many were forced to engage in a \"drill\" that included rolling, creeping, hopping, and running for 75 minutes while camp guards kicked and beat them, while others, forced to work in stone quarries, were refused medical attention when sick. Despite persecution, Jehovah's Witnesses continued to hold secret religious gatherings inside the camps.\n[34284695#8] Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs - Witnesses believe that after the death of the apostles, the Church embarked on a \"Great Apostasy\", diverging from the original teachings of Jesus on several major points. Influenced by Restorationism in the 19th century, Charles Taze Russell and his associates formed a Bible study group in the 1870s in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, developing teachings that they considered to be a revival of \"the great truths taught by Jesus and the Apostles\". Watch Tower publications claim both the Great Apostasy and Russell's subsequent \"restoration\" of original Christianity were a fulfilment of Jesus' parable of the wheat and the weeds at Matthew 13:24-30,36-43. Although many of their eschatological teachings have changed over the years, Jehovah's Witnesses have consistently claimed to be the only true religion. Based on their interpretation of Revelation 18:2-24, Jehovah's Witnesses believe all other religions are part of \"Babylon the Great\", a \"world empire of false religion\" under the control of Satan; consequently, they refuse all ecumenical relations with other religious denominations.\n[2303855#3] Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses - During the World Wars, Jehovah's Witnesses were targeted in the United States, Canada, and many other countries for their refusal to serve in the military or help with war efforts. In Canada, Jehovah's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Japanese and Chinese descent. Activities of Jehovah's Witnesses have previously been banned in the Soviet Union and in Spain, partly due to their refusal to perform military service. Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries, for example in Singapore, China, Vietnam, Russia and many Muslim-majority countries.\n[13949533#3] Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany - Jehovah's Witnesses were an outgrowth of the International Bible Students, who began missionary work in Europe in the 1890s. A German branch office of the Watch Tower Society opened in Elberfeld in 1902. By 1933, almost 20,000 Witnesses were counted as active door-to-door preachers, and their annual Memorial service was attracting almost 25,000 people. In Dresden, there were more Bible Students than in New York, where the Watch Tower Society was headquartered.\n[2303855#40] Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses - Jehovah's Witnesses did not have a significant presence in the Soviet Union prior to 1939 when the Soviet Union forcibly incorporated eastern Poland, Moldavia, and Lithuania, each of which had a Jehovah's Witness movement. Although never large in number (estimated by the KGB to be 20,000 in 1968), the Jehovah's Witnesses became one of the most persecuted religious groups in the Soviet Union during the post-World War II era. Members were arrested or deported; some were put in Soviet concentration camps. Witnesses in Moldavian SSR were deported to Tomsk Oblast; members from other regions of the Soviet Union were deported to Irkutsk Oblast. KGB officials, who were tasked with dissolving the Jehovah's Witness movement, were disturbed to discover that the Witnesses continued to practice their faith even within the labor camps.\n[140541#3] Corporations of Jehovah's Witnesses - Originally known as the \"Peoples Pulpit Association\", the organization was incorporated in 1909 when the Society's principal offices moved to Brooklyn, New York. In 1939, it was renamed \"Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc.\", and in 1956 the name was changed to \"Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc\". Until 2000, a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses was president of both the \"Watch Tower\" (Pennsylvania) and \"Watchtower\" (New York) corporations, as well as Britain's International Bible Students Association corporation; in 2001, it was decided that the corporations' directors need not be members of the Governing Body.\"Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, Inc.\" was established to organize and administer the congregational affairs of Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States. It filed for incorporation on August 21, 2000 in New York State as a “domestic non-profit corporation” in Putnam County, New York. An incorporation record was also filed with the State of Florida on March 3, 2006, as a \"foreign non profit corporation\" with agency in Collier County, Florida.\n[2384370#3] Jehovah's Witnesses splinter groups - Scholars estimate that during the Nazi regime, about half of all Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany were incarcerated in prison or concentration camps, where they were exposed to \"sadism marked by an unending chain of physical and mental tortures, the likes of which no language in the world can express.\" At the time, they were represented by several geographical Bible Students Associations, each of which considered itself affiliated with the Watch Tower Society despite little contact with their US headquarters in Brooklyn. When contact was re-established, a minority of German Jehovah's Witnesses either preferred their autonomy or disagreed with the doctrinal changes that had occurred in the meantime. Some disassociated themselves from the Watch Tower Society and some individual members established contact with non-Jehovah's Witness Bible Student groups.\n[1364162#53] Religion in the Soviet Union - Jehovah's Witnesses were banned from practicing their religion. Under Operation North, the personal property of over eight-thousand members was confiscated, and they (along with underage children) were exiled to Siberia from 1951 until repeal in 1965. All were asked to sign a declaration of resignation as a Jehovah's Witness in order to not be deported. There is no existing record of any having signed this declaration. While in Siberia, some men, women, and children were forced to work as lumberjacks for a fixed wage. Victims reported living conditions to be very poor. From 1951 to 1991, Jehovah's Witnesses within and outside Siberia were incarcerated – and then rearrested after serving their terms. Some were forced to work in concentration camps, others forcibly enrolled in Marxist reeducation programs. KGB officials infiltrated the Jehovah's Witnesses organization in the Soviet Union, mostly to seek out hidden caches of theological literature. Soviet propaganda films depicted Jehovah's Witnesses as a cult, extremist, and engaging in mind control. Jehovah's Witnesses were legalized in the Soviet Union in 1991; victims were given social benefits equivalent to those of war veterans.\n[3897876#14] History of Jehovah's Witnesses - Two missionaries were sent to England in 1881 and overseas branches were opened in London (1900), Germany (1903) and Australia and Switzerland (1904). The Watch Tower Society's headquarters were transferred to Brooklyn, New York in 1908.\nIn 1910 Russell introduced the name \"International Bible Students Association\" as a means of identifying his worldwide community of Bible study groups. The name was also used when advertising and conducting conventions of Russell's followers.\n[3897876#0] History of Jehovah's Witnesses - Jehovah's Witnesses originated as a branch of the Bible Student movement, which developed in the United States in the 1870s among followers of Christian Restorationist minister Charles Taze Russell. Bible Student missionaries were sent to England in 1881 and the first overseas branch was opened in London in 1900. The group took on the name International Bible Students Association and by 1914 it was also active in Canada, Germany, Australia and other countries. The movement split into several rival organizations after Russell's death in 1916, with one—led by Russell's successor, Joseph \"Judge\" Rutherford—retaining control of both his magazine, \"The Watch Tower\", and his legal and publishing corporation, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: Where was Jonathan Swift born?\n\nContexts: [15614#5] Jonathan Swift - At the age of one, child Jonathan was taken by his wet nurse to her hometown of Whitehaven, Cumberland, England. He said that there he learned to read the Bible. His nurse returned him to his mother, still in Ireland, when he was three.\n[23576614#3] Rigby Swift - Swift was born on 7 June 1874 at Hardshaw Hall, Lancashire to Thomas Swift and his second wife Emily. The male members of the family were mostly lawyers - Thomas Swift was a solicitor, three of his sons also became solicitors, his brother was a registrar and his cousin, Sir John Rigby was a barrister and later judge. After John Rigby became a King's Counsel in 1880, Thomas Swift switched paths and became a barrister. He specialised in criminal work, and served as counsel in the trial of Florence Maybrick. His career change had a great impact on the family - they moved from Lancashire to Liverpool (where Thomas Swift's Chambers were) and Rigby Swift was undoubtedly influenced by his father's career when it came to choosing one of his own.\n[53654245#1] John Swift (trade unionist) - Born in Dundalk, Swift was educated at a Christian Brothers School. His father ran a co-operative bakery but this closed and the family endured poverty. In 1914, Swift began an apprenticeship at a bakery in Dublin, and spent much of his spare time attending meetings where Jim Larkin was speaking. He briefly joined the Irish Volunteers, but took time out following an accident, and decided not to rejoin due to Larkin's opposition to the organisation.\n[15614#3] Jonathan Swift - Jonathan Swift was born on 30 November 1667 in Dublin, Ireland. He was the second child and only son of Jonathan Swift (1640–1667) and his wife Abigail Erick (or Herrick) of Frisby on the Wreake. His father was a native of Goodrich, Herefordshire, but he accompanied his brothers to Ireland to seek their fortunes in law after their Royalist father's estate was brought to ruin during the English Civil War. His maternal grandfather, James Ericke, was the vicar of Thornton, England. In 1634 the vicar was convicted of Puritan practices. Some time thereafter, Ericke and his family, including his young daughter Abilgail, fled to Ireland.\n[15614#9] Jonathan Swift - Swift was studying for his master's degree when political troubles in Ireland surrounding the Glorious Revolution forced him to leave for England in 1688, where his mother helped him get a position as secretary and personal assistant of Sir William Temple at Moor Park, Farnham. Temple was an English diplomat who arranged the Triple Alliance of 1668. He had retired from public service to his country estate to tend his gardens and write his memoirs. Gaining his employer's confidence, Swift \"was often trusted with matters of great importance\". Within three years of their acquaintance, Temple had introduced his secretary to William III and sent him to London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial Parliaments.\n[1879544#1] Joseph Gardner Swift - Swift was born on Nantucket Island, the son of Foster Swift and his wife, Deborah. At the age of six, he saw George Washington on Boston Common, an experience that made an indelible impression on him.\nIn 1792, the Swifts moved to Taunton, Massachusetts, where Joseph became the student of Reverend Samuel Daggat, who prepared him to enter Harvard College. Swift had read accounts of the American Revolution in his father’s diary and heard stories from a family friend, Major General David Cobb. With Cobb’s advice and assistance, Swift was appointed by President John Adams on May 12, 1800 as a cadet of artillerists and engineers. He reported for duty a month later at Newport Harbor.\n[12668177#1] Swift's silver mine - The legend of Swift's silver mine is based on accounts given in the journal of an Englishman named Jonathan Swift. Swift claimed to have preceded Daniel Boone into Kentucky, coming to the region in 1760 on a series of mining expeditions. The journal recounts how a wounded bear led Swift to a vein of silver ore in a cave, and how that for the next nine years, he made annual treks back to the site of the mine, carrying out \"silver bars and minted coins.\" An article in an 1886 edition of \"Harper's Magazine\" tells how Swift supposedly buried a good deal of the treasure at various locations:\n[15614#10] Jonathan Swift - Swift took up his residence at Moor Park where he met Esther Johnson, then eight years old, the daughter of an impoverished widow who acted as companion to Temple's sister Lady Giffard. Swift was her tutor and mentor, giving her the nickname \"Stella\", and the two maintained a close but ambiguous relationship for the rest of Esther's life.\n[294082#11] A Tale of a Tub - Born of English parents in Ireland, Jonathan Swift was working as Sir William Temple's secretary at the time he composed \"A Tale of a Tub\" (1694–1697). The publication of the work coincided with Swift's striking out on his own, having despaired of getting a good \"living\" from Temple or Temple's influence. There is speculation about what caused the rift between Swift and his employer, but, as A. C. Elias persuasively argues, it seems that the final straw came with Swift's work on Temple's \"Letters.\" Swift had been engaged to translate Temple's French correspondence, but Temple, or someone close to Temple, edited the French text to make Temple seem both prescient and more fluent. Consequently, the letters and the translations Swift provided did not gibe, and, since Swift could not accuse Temple of falsifying his letters, and because the public would never believe that the retired state minister had lied, Swift came across as incompetent.\nEven though Swift published the \"Tale\" as he left Temple's service, it was conceived earlier, and the book is a salvo in one of Temple's battles. Swift's general polemic concerns an argument (the \"Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns\") that had been over for nearly ten years by the time the book was published. The \"Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns\" was a French academic debate of the early 1690s, occasioned by Fontenelle arguing that modern scholarship had allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge. Temple argued against this position in his \"On Ancient and Modern Learning\" (where he provided the first English formulation of the commonplace that modern critics see more only because they are dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants), and Temple's somewhat naive essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were Richard Bentley (classicist and editor) and William Wotton (critic).\n[15614#15] Jonathan Swift - Swift had residence in Trim, County Meath, after 1700. He wrote many of his works during this time period. In February 1702, Swift received his Doctor of Divinity degree from Trinity College, Dublin. That spring he travelled to England and then returned to Ireland in October, accompanied by Esther Johnson—now 20—and his friend Rebecca Dingley, another member of William Temple's household. There is a great mystery and controversy over Swift's relationship with Esther Johnson, nicknamed \"Stella\". Many, notably his close friend Thomas Sheridan, believed that they were secretly married in 1716; others, like Swift's housekeeper Mrs Brent and Rebecca Dingley (who lived with Stella all through her years in Ireland) dismissed the story as absurd. Swift certainly did not wish her to marry anyone else: in 1704, when their mutual friend William Tisdall informed Swift that he intended to propose to Stella, Swift wrote to him to dissuade him from the idea. Although the tone of the letter was courteous, Swift privately expressed his disgust for Tisdall as an \"interloper\", and they were estranged for many years.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: How large is Bengal by area?\n\nContexts: [6758087#0] Sagar Island - Sagar Island is an island in the Ganges delta, lying on the continental shelf of Bay of Bengal about 100 km (54 nautical miles) south of Kolkata. This island forms the Sagar CD Block in Kakdwip subdivision of South 24 Parganas district in the Indian State of West Bengal. The island is large — with an area of 224.3 km², lying between 21°36’ to 21°56’ north latitude and 88°2’ to 88° 11’ east latitude. It has 43 villages and a population of over 160,000. The largest village is also named \"Ganga Sagar\" or \"Gangasagar\". Although Sagar island is a part of Sunderban Administration, it does not have any tiger habitation or mangrove forests or small river tributaries as is characteristic of the overall sunderban delta.\n[10442499#8] Bengal slow loris - The preferred habitats of the Bengal slow loris range across tropical and subtropical regions, and include evergreen and semi-evergreen rainforests with forest edges and continuous, dense canopies. It can also be found in bamboo groves. It prefers habitats with larger diameter, tall trees with a large crown depth (defined as the length along the main axis from the tree tip to the base of the crown); these areas are typically associated with greater food abundance, and decreased risk of predation. Because of its preference for dense forests, it acts as a good indicator of the ecosystem's health.\n[4308757#11] Geography of West Bengal - A small coastal region is on the extreme south of the state. A part of the district of Purba Medinipur along the Bay of Bengal constitutes the coastal plain. This emergent coastal plain is made up of sand and mud deposited by rivers and by wind. Parallel to the coast are colonies of sand dunes and marshy areas. The Digha dune lies nearest to the Bay of Bengal while the Kanthi dune is the farthest from it. In some areas dunes occur at a distance of 15–16 km from the coast and are 11–12 m high.\n[4862#57] Bengal - The Bengal region is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. With a population of 300 million, Bengalis are the third largest ethnic group in the world after the Han Chinese and Arabs.\nAccording to provisional results of 2011 Bangladesh census, the population of Bangladesh was 142,319,000; however, CIA's \"The World Factbook\" gives 163,654,860 as its population in a July 2013 estimate. According to the provisional results of the 2011 Indian national census, West Bengal has a population of 91,347,736. So, the Bengal region, , has at least 233 million people. This figures give a population density of 1003.9/km; making it among the most densely populated areas in the world.\n[34040#18] West Bengal - As per the India State of Forest Report 2017, recorded forest area in the state is , while in 2013, forest area was , which was 18.93% of the state's geographical area, compared to the then national average of 21.23%. Reserves and protected and unclassed forests constitute 59.4%, 31.8%, and 8.9%, respectively, of forested areas, as of 2009. Part of the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans is located in southern West Bengal.\nFrom a phytogeographic viewpoint, the southern part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile. Much of the vegetation of the western part of the state has similar species composition with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand. The predominant commercial tree species is \"Shorea robusta\", commonly known as the sal tree. The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the \"Casuarina\". A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous \"sundari\" (\"Heritiera fomes\"), from which the forest gets its name.\n[7282876#4] Eastern Bengal and Assam - Eastern Bengal and Assam had a total area of 111,569 sq m and was situated between 20° 45' and 28° 17' N., and between 87° 48' and 97° 5' E. It was bounded by Tibet and the Kingdom of Bhutan to the north, British Burma to the east and the Bay of Bengal to the south. Within these limits, were the princely states of Hill Tippera, Cooch Behar and Manipur.\n[47892#1] Bay of Bengal - The Bay of Bengal occupies an area of . A number of large rivers flow into the Bay of Bengal: the Ganges-Hooghly, the Padma, the Brahmaputra-Jamuna, the Barak-Surma-Meghna, the Irrawaddy, the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Brahmani, the Baitarani, the Krishna and the Kaveri. Among the important ports are Chennai-Ennore, Chittagong, Colombo, Kolkata-Haldia, Mongla, Paradip, Port Blair, Tuticorin, Visakhapatnam and Yangon,Dhamra . Among the smaller ports are Gopalpur Port, Kakinada and Payra.\n[28473733#1] Greater Bangladesh - After the Maratha rebellions in Northern India the Bengal province became autonomous and was ruled by the Nawab of Bengal however after the Battle of Plassey the region became the administrative division of British India with Bengal's capital Calcutta becoming the Indian capital. Bengal Presidency was formed in 1765. In 1905, the presidency was divided into Bengal province and East Bengal and Assam province. In 1911, Bengal was reunited. Assam including Meghalaya and Sylhet was severed from the Presidency in 1874. Assam became the Province of Assam together with Lushai Hills in 1912. In 1912 Bengal was separated into various states of the British empire after being a tense area of the Indian independence movement. These new provinces were Bihar and Orissa and East Bengal and Assam however the westernmost part of the Bihar and Orissa province and East Bengal were reunited to become a smaller but yet united Bengal. This province was partitioned again in 1947 into Hindu-majority West Bengal and Muslim-majority East Bengal (now Bangladesh) to facilitate the creation of the separate Muslim state of Pakistan, of which East Bengal became a province.\n[40096#76] History of Bangladesh - The decision to effect the Partition of Bengal was announced in July 1905 by the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon. The partition took place on 16 October 1905 and separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas. The former province of Bengal was divided into two new provinces \"Bengal\" (comprising western Bengal as well as the province of Bihar and Orissa) and Eastern Bengal and Assam with Dacca as the capital of the latter. Partition was promoted for administrative reasons: Bengal was geographically as large as France and had a significantly larger population. Curzon stated the eastern region was neglected and under-governed. By splitting the province, an improved administration could be established in the east, where subsequently, the population would benefit from new schools and employment opportunities. The Hindus of West Bengal who dominated Bengal's business and rural life complained that the division would make them a minority in a province that would incorporate the province of Bihar and Orissa. Indians were outraged at what they recognised as a \"divide and rule\" policy.\n[4862#11] Bengal - Most of the Bengal region lies in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, but there are highlands in its north, northeast and southeast. The Ganges Delta arises from the confluence of the rivers Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers and their respective tributaries. The total area of Bengal is 232,752  km—West Bengal is and Bangladesh .\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When did Voltaire publish Candide?\n\nContexts: [6629#3] Candide - A number of historical events inspired Voltaire to write \"Candide\", most notably the publication of Leibniz's \"Monadology\", a short metaphysical treatise, the Seven Years' War, and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Both of the latter catastrophes are frequently referred to in \"Candide\" and are cited by scholars as reasons for its composition. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, tsunami, and resulting fires of All Saints' Day, had a strong influence on theologians of the day and on Voltaire, who was himself disillusioned by them. The earthquake had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism, a philosophical system which implies that such events should not occur. Optimism is founded on the theodicy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and says all is for the best because God is a benevolent deity. This concept is often put into the form, \"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\" (). Philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into their optimistic world view.\nVoltaire actively rejected Leibnizian optimism after the natural disaster, convinced that if this were the best possible world, it should surely be better than it is. In both \"Candide\" and (\"Poem on the Lisbon Disaster\"), Voltaire attacks this optimist belief. He makes use of the Lisbon earthquake in both \"Candide\" and his to argue this point, sarcastically describing the catastrophe as one of the most horrible disasters \"in the best of all possible worlds\". Immediately after the earthquake, unreliable rumours circulated around Europe, sometimes overestimating the severity of the event. Ira Wade, a noted expert on Voltaire and \"Candide\", has analyzed which sources Voltaire might have referenced in learning of the event. Wade speculates that Voltaire's primary source for information on the Lisbon earthquake was the 1755 work by Ange Goudar.\n[10497747#0] Candide, Part II - Candide, or Optimism — Part II is an apocryphal picaresque novel, possibly written by Thorel de Campigneulles (1737–1809) or Henri Joseph Du Laurens (1719–1797), published in 1760. \"Candide\" was written by Voltaire and had been published a year earlier (1759). This work was banned and became popular enough that The second part was attributed to both Campigneulles—\"a now largely unknown writer of third-rate moralising novels;\" and Laurens—who is suspected of having habitually plagiarised Voltaire. The story continued with Candide new adventures in the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and Denmark.\nA new scholarly edition with introduction and notes all in French was produced in 2003 by Edouard Langille (see References), and in 2007, Langille also edited \"Candide en Dannemarc\" (\"Candide in Denmark\"), which takes up the story following \"Candide, Part II\".\n[12281#98] Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz - When Leibniz died, his reputation was in decline. He was remembered for only one book, the \"Théodicée\", whose supposed central argument Voltaire lampooned in his popular book \"Candide\", which concludes with the character Candide saying, \"\"Non liquet\"\" (it is not clear), a term that was applied during the Roman Republic to a legal verdict of \"not proven\". Voltaire's depiction of Leibniz's ideas was so influential that many believed it to be an accurate description. Thus Voltaire and his \"Candide\" bear some of the blame for the lingering failure to appreciate and understand Leibniz's ideas. Leibniz had an ardent disciple, Christian Wolff, whose dogmatic and facile outlook did Leibniz's reputation much harm. He also influenced David Hume who read his \"Théodicée\" and used some of his ideas. In any event, philosophical fashion was moving away from the rationalism and system building of the 17th century, of which Leibniz had been such an ardent proponent. His work on law, diplomacy, and history was seen as of ephemeral interest. The vastness and richness of his correspondence went unrecognized.\n[6629#7] Candide - It is unknown exactly when Voltaire wrote \"Candide\", but scholars estimate that it was primarily composed in late 1758 and begun as early as 1757. Voltaire is believed to have written a portion of it while living at Les Délices near Geneva and also while visiting Charles Théodore, the Elector-Palatinate at Schwetzingen, for three weeks in the summer of 1758. Despite solid evidence for these claims, a popular legend persists that Voltaire wrote \"Candide\" in three days. This idea is probably based on a misreading of the 1885 work by Lucien Perey (real name: Clara Adèle Luce Herpin) and Gaston Maugras. The evidence indicates strongly that Voltaire did not rush or improvise \"Candide\", but worked on it over a significant period of time, possibly even a whole year. \"Candide\" is mature and carefully developed, not impromptu, as the intentionally choppy plot and the aforementioned myth might suggest.\nThere is only one extant manuscript of \"Candide\" that was written before the work's 1759 publication; it was discovered in 1956 by Wade and since named the \"La Vallière Manuscript\". It is believed to have been sent, chapter by chapter, by Voltaire to the Duke and Duchess La Vallière in the autumn of 1758. The manuscript was sold to the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in the late eighteenth century, where it remained undiscovered for almost two hundred years. The \"La Vallière Manuscript\", the most original and authentic of all surviving copies of \"Candide\", was probably dictated by Voltaire to his secretary, Jean-Louis Wagnière, then edited directly. In addition to this manuscript, there is believed to have been another, one copied by Wagnière for the Elector Charles-Théodore, who hosted Voltaire during the summer of 1758. The existence of this copy was first postulated by Norman L. Torrey in 1929. If it exists, it remains undiscovered.\nVoltaire published \"Candide\" simultaneously in five countries no later than 15 January 1759, although the exact date is uncertain. Seventeen versions of \"Candide\" from 1759, in the original French, are known today, and there has been great controversy over which is the earliest. More versions were published in other languages: \"Candide\" was translated once into Italian and thrice into English that same year. The complicated science of calculating the relative publication dates of all of the versions of \"Candide\" is described at length in Wade's article \"The First Edition of \"Candide\": A Problem of Identification\". The publication process was extremely secretive, probably the \"most clandestine work of the century\", because of the book's obviously illicit and irreverent content. The greatest number of copies of \"Candide\" were published concurrently in Geneva by Cramer, in Amsterdam by Marc-Michel Rey, in London by Jean Nourse, and in Paris by Lambert.\n\"Candide\" underwent one major revision after its initial publication, in addition to some minor ones. In 1761, a version of \"Candide\" was published that included, along with several minor changes, a major addition by Voltaire to the twenty-second chapter, a section that had been thought weak by the Duke of Vallière. The English title of this edition was \"Candide, or Optimism, Translated from the German of Dr. Ralph. With the additions found in the Doctor's pocket when he died at Minden, in the Year of Grace 1759.\" The last edition of \"Candide\" authorised by Voltaire was the one included in Cramer's 1775 edition of his complete\n[32375#22] Voltaire - Early in 1759, Voltaire completed and published \"Candide, ou l'Optimisme\" (\"Candide, or Optimism\"). This satire on Leibniz's philosophy of optimistic determinism remains the work for which Voltaire is perhaps best known. He would stay in Ferney for most of the remaining 20 years of his life, frequently entertaining distinguished guests, such as James Boswell, Adam Smith, Giacomo Casanova, and Edward Gibbon. In 1764, he published one of his best-known philosophical works, the \"Dictionnaire philosophique\", a series of articles mainly on Christian history and dogmas, a few of which were originally written in Berlin.\n[6629#47] Candide - In 1760, one year after Voltaire published \"Candide\", a sequel was published with the name . This work is attributed both to Thorel de Campigneulles, a writer unknown today, and Henri Joseph Du Laurens, who is suspected of having habitually plagiarised Voltaire. The story continues in this sequel with Candide having new adventures in the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and Denmark. \"Part II\" has potential use in studies of the popular and literary receptions of \"Candide\", but is almost certainly apocryphal. In total, by the year 1803, at least ten imitations of \"Candide\" or continuations of its story were published by authors other than Voltaire.\nThe operetta \"Candide\" was originally conceived by playwright Lillian Hellman, as a play with incidental music. Leonard Bernstein, the American composer and conductor who wrote the music, was so excited about the project that he convinced Hellman to do it as a \"comic operetta\". Many lyricists worked on the show, including James Agee, Dorothy Parker, John Latouche, Richard Wilbur, Leonard and Felicia Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim and Hellman. Hershy Kay orchestrated all the pieces except for the overture, which Bernstein did himself. \"Candide\" first opened on Broadway as a musical on 1 December 1956. The premier production was directed by Tyrone Guthrie and conducted by Samuel Krachmalnick. While this production was a box office flop, the music was highly praised, and an original cast album was made. The album gradually became a cult hit, but Hellman's libretto was criticised as being too serious an adaptation of Voltaire's novel. \"Candide\" would be more popular seventeen years later with a new libretto by Hugh Wheeler.\n[370894#2] The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia - While the story is thematically similar to \"Candide\" by Voltaire, also published early in 1759 – both concern young men travelling in the company of honoured teachers, encountering and examining human suffering in an attempt to determine the root of happiness – their root concerns are distinctly different. Voltaire was very directly satirising the widely read philosophical work by Gottfried Leibniz, particularly the \"Theodicee\", in which Leibniz asserts that the world, no matter how we may perceive it, is necessarily the \"best of all possible worlds\". In contrast the question Rasselas confronts most directly is whether or not humanity is essentially capable of attaining happiness. Rasselas questions his choices in life and what new choices to make in order to achieve this happiness. Writing as a devout Christian, Johnson makes through his characters no blanket attacks on the viability of a religious response to this question, as Voltaire does, and while the story is in places light and humorous, it is not a piece of satire, as is \"Candide\".\n[6629#0] Candide - ' (; ) is a French satire first published in 1759 by Voltaire, a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment. The novella has been widely translated, with English versions titled Candide: or, All for the Best (1759); Candide: or, The Optimist (1762); and Candide: Optimism\"\"' (1947). It begins with a young man, Candide, who is living a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism by his mentor, Professor Pangloss. The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, followed by Candide's slow and painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes with Candide, if not rejecting Leibnizian optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, \"we must cultivate our garden\", in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, \"all is for the best\" in the \"best of all possible worlds\".\n[32375#9] Voltaire - At Brussels, Voltaire and Rousseau met up for a few days, before Voltaire and his mistress continued northwards. A publisher was eventually secured in The Hague. In the Netherlands, Voltaire was struck and impressed by the openness and tolerance of Dutch society. On his return to France, he secured a second publisher in Rouen, who agreed to publish \"La Henriade\" clandestinely. After Voltaire's recovery from a month-long smallpox infection in November 1723, the first copies were smuggled into Paris and distributed. While the poem was an instant success, Voltaire's new play, \"Mariamne\", was a failure when it first opened in March 1724. Heavily reworked, it opened at the \"Comédie-Française\" in April 1725 to a much-improved reception. It was among the entertainments provided at the wedding of Louis XV and Marie Leszczyńska in September 1725.\n[6629#37] Candide - Separate from the debate about the text's conclusion is the \"inside/outside\" controversy. This argument centers on the matter of whether or not Voltaire was actually prescribing anything. Roy Wolper, professor emeritus of English, argues in a revolutionary 1969 paper that \"Candide\" does not necessarily speak for its author; that the work should be viewed as a narrative independent of Voltaire's history; and that its message is entirely (or mostly) it. This point of view, the \"inside\", specifically rejects attempts to find Voltaire's \"voice\" in the many characters of \"Candide\" and his other works. Indeed, writers have seen Voltaire as speaking through at least Candide, Martin, and the Turk. Wolper argues that \"Candide\" should be read with a minimum of speculation as to its meaning in Voltaire's personal life. His article ushered in a new era of Voltaire studies, causing many scholars to look at the novel differently.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

It was built in 1955, and spans the Kanawha River, carrying West Virginia Route 34. The cantilever through-truss consists of two anchor spans each 245 feet in length and the main span 462 feet in length between pier center lines. The main span consists of two 128 feet, 4 inch, cantilever arms and a 205 feet, 4 inch, suspended span.\n[32087#1] United States Army - As a uniformed military service, the U.S. Army is part of the Department of the Army, which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense. The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant, the Secretary of the Army (SECARMY) and by a chief military officer, the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is the largest military branch, and in the fiscal year 2017, the projected end strength for the Regular Army (USA) was 476,000 soldiers; the Army National Guard (ARNG) had 343,000 soldiers and the United States Army Reserve (USAR) had 199,000 soldiers; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was 1,018,000 soldiers. As a branch of the armed forces, the mission of the U.S. Army is \"to fight and win our Nation's wars, by providing prompt, sustained, land dominance, across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict, in support of combatant commanders\". The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States.\n[17873743#25] Lord's Resistance Army - In 2007, the government of Uganda claimed that the LRA had only 500 or 1,000 soldiers in total, but other sources estimated that there could have been as many as 3,000 soldiers, along with about 1,500 women and children. By 2011, unofficial estimates were in the range of 300 to 400 combatants, with more than half believed to be abductees. The soldiers are organized into independent squads of 10 or 20 soldiers. By early 2012, the LRA had been reduced to a force of between 200 and 250 fighters, according to Ugandan defence minister Crispus Kiyonga. Abou Moussa, the UN envoy in the region, said in March 2012 that the LRA was believed to have dwindled to between 200 and 700 followers but still remained a threat: \"The most important thing is that no matter how little the LRA may be, it still constitutes a danger [as] they continue to attack and create havoc.\"\n[15400166#3] Anzacs (TV series) - The actors playing British officers and politicians were almost all New Zealanders. Many of the extras playing the roles of Allied, American, and German soldiers were serving members of the Australian Army. This was done to keep costs down so that actors did not have to learn how to act as soldiers or to have to teach them how to use the weapons. Many of the actors would also appear on the US TV series \"\" which was filmed mostly in Australia.\n[5997706#2] Reorganization plan of United States Army - In the fall of 2018, Army Strategy for the next ten years was articulated. The strategy listed four Lines of Effort to be implemented:\nBefore General Schoomaker's tenure, the Army was organized around large, mostly mechanized divisions, of around 15,000 soldiers each, with the aim of being able to fight two major theatres simultaneously. Under the new plan, the Army would be organized around modular brigades of 3,000–4,000 soldiers each, with the aim of being able to deploy continuously in different parts of the world, and effectively organizing the Army closer to the way it fights. An additional 30,000 soldiers were recruited as a short-term measure to assist in the structural changes, although a permanent end-strength change was not expected because of fears of future funding cuts, forcing the Army to pay for the additional personnel from procurement and readiness accounts. Up to 60% of the defense budget is spent on personnel and an extra 10,000 soldiers would cost US$1.4 billion annually.\n[215140#54] American imperialism - By 1970, the United States had more than 1,000,000 soldiers in 30 countries, was a member of four regional defense alliances and an active participant in a fifth, had mutual defense treaties with 42 nations, was a member of 53 international organizations, and was furnishing military or economic aid to nearly 100 nations across the face of the globe. In 2015 the Department of Defense reported the number of bases that had any military or civilians stationed or employed was 587. This includes land only (where no facilities are present), facility or facilities only (where there the underlying land is neither owned nor controlled by the government), and land with facilities (where both are present). Also in 2015, David Vine's book Base Nation, found 800 US military bases located outside of the US, including 174 bases in Germany, 113 in Japan, and 83 in South Korea, the total costs, an estimated $100 billion a year.\n[4132121#5] Korean Augmentation To the United States Army - The number of candidates vying for an available opening is extremely high because many soldiers believe that the U.S. Army is less abusive and more professional in its training and treatment of soldiers compared with the ROK Army, and that junior enlisted personnel receive better treatment, have more educational opportunities (especially with regards to learning English), experience a higher standard of living, and have an overall better quality of life than their ROK counterparts. In 2012, roughly 3,400 KATUSA soldiers served with 25,000 United States Forces Korea (USFK), versus 4,800 in 2005 and 11,000 in 1968. As the number of U.S. soldiers in South Korea decreases, the number of KATUSA soldiers is decreasing as well. The ratio of KATUSA soldiers to U.S. soldiers is roughly 1:10.\n[15068#10] Infantry - In the modern US Army, about 15% of soldiers are officially \"Infantry\". The basic training for all new US Army soldiers includes use of infantry weapons and tactics, even for tank crews, artillery crews, and base and logistical personnel.\n[32087#38] United States Army - The U.S. Army currently consists of 10 active divisions and one deployable division headquarters (7th Infantry Division) as well as several independent units. The force is in the process of contracting after several years of growth. In June 2013, the Army announced plans to downsize to 32 active combat brigade teams by 2015 to match a reduction in active duty strength to 490,000 soldiers. Army Chief of Staff Raymond Odierno projected that the Army was to shrink to \"450,000 in the active component, 335,000 in the National Guard and 195,000 in U.S. Army Reserve\" by 2018. However, this plan was scrapped by the new administration and now the Army plans to grow by 16,000 soldiers to a total of 476,000 by October 2017. The National Guard and the Army Reserve will see a smaller expansion.\n[36920007#36] Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan - The US force level will drop to between 10,000 and 20,000 troops according to the Long War Journal. They will consist of Special Forces, counterterrorism forces, and military training personnel. They will be deployed to a small number of bases around the country. US/ISAF troops will continue their training of Afghan National Security Forces soldiers. Counterterrorism forces will concentrate mostly on high-value targets. U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated on 12 November 2012 that the Obama Administration will cease combat operations by the end of 2014, but it is still refining its timeline for withdrawing the remaining 68,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The administration was also debating how many trainers, Special Operations forces and military assets it will keep in the country after that to support Afghanistan's army and police.\n[32087#17] United States Army - In 1939, estimates of the Army's strength range between 174,000 and 200,000 soldiers, smaller than that of Portugal's, which ranked it 17th or 19th in the world in size. General George C. Marshall became Army Chief of Staff in September 1939 and set about expanding and modernizing the Army in preparation for war.\nThe United States joined World War II in December 1941 after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. On the European front, U.S. Army troops formed a significant portion of the forces that captured North Africa and Sicily and later fought in Italy. On D-Day 6 June 1944 and in the subsequent liberation of Europe and defeat of Nazi Germany, millions of U.S. Army troops played a central role. In the Pacific War, U.S. Army soldiers participated alongside the United States Marine Corps in capturing the Pacific Islands from Japanese control. Following the Axis surrenders in May (Germany) and August (Japan) of 1945, army troops were deployed to Japan and Germany to occupy the two defeated nations. Two years after World War II, the Army Air Forces separated from the army to become the United States Air Force in September 1947. In 1948, the army was desegregated by order of President Harry S. Truman.\n[32087#36] United States Army - See Structure of the United States Army for detailed treatment of the history, components, administrative and operational structure and the branches and functional areas of the Army.\nThe U.S. Army is made up of three components: the active component, the Regular Army; and two reserve components, the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. Both reserve components are primarily composed of part-time soldiers who train once a month – known as battle assemblies or unit training assemblies (UTAs) – and conduct two to three weeks of annual training each year. Both the Regular Army and the Army Reserve are organized under Title 10 of the United States Code, while the National Guard is organized under Title 32. While the Army National Guard is organized, trained and equipped as a component of the U.S. Army, when it is not in federal service it is under the command of individual state and territorial governors. However, the District of Columbia National Guard reports to the U.S. President, not the district's mayor, even when not federalized. Any or all of the National Guard can be federalized by presidential order and against the governor's wishes.\nThe U.S. Army is led by a civilian Secretary of the Army, who has the statutory authority to conduct all the affairs of the army under the authority, direction and control of the Secretary of Defense. The Chief of Staff of the Army, who is the highest-ranked military officer in the army, serves as the principal military adviser and executive agent for the Secretary of the Army, i.e., its service chief; and as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a body composed of the service chiefs from each of the four military services belonging to the Department of Defense who advise the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Council on operational military matters, under the guidance of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In 1986, the Goldwater–Nichols Act mandated that operational control of the services follows a chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the unified combatant commanders, who have control of all armed forces units in their geographic or function area of responsibility, thus the secretaries of the military departments (and their respective service chiefs underneath them) only have the responsibility to organize, train and equip their service components. The army provides trained forces to the combatant commanders for use as directed by the Secretary of Defense.\nBy 2013, the army shifted to six geographical commands that align with the six geographical unified combatant commands (COCOM):\nThe army also transformed its base unit from divisions to brigades. Division lineage will be retained, but the divisional headquarters will be able to command any brigade, not just brigades that carry their divisional lineage. The central part of this plan is that each brigade will be modular, i.e., all brigades of the same type will be exactly the same and thus any brigade can be commanded by any division. As specified before the 2013 end-strength re-definitions, the three major types of ground combat brigades are:\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When was NHK founded in Japan?\n\nContexts: [9022261#10] Clock ident - In Japan, NHK had a clock from 1969 to 1985. The clock had a blue background and the clock piece was white; on the face plate multiples of 3 had two bars while the other numbers had one bar. There was also an NHK logo near the clock. A variant of that clock design had a wooden background. NHK introduced many clock designs after 1985, although the classic clock as mentioned earlier continued to remain in occasional use as recently as the early-1990s. NHK still broadcasts clocks prior to the 7am news, but does not do so during sign-on or sign-off since it started broadcasting 24 hours a day in 1989.\n[178808#51] Public broadcasting - In Japan, the main public broadcaster is the NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation). The broadcaster was set up in 1926 and was modelled on the British Broadcasting Company, the precursor to the British Broadcasting Corporation created in 1927. Much like the BBC, NHK is funded by a \"receiving fee\" from every Japanese household, with no commercial advertising and the maintenance of a position of strict political impartiality. However, rampant non-payment by a large amount of households has led the receiving fee to become something of a political issue. NHK runs two national terrestrial TV stations (NHK General and NHK Educational) and two satellite only services (NHK BS1 and NHK BS Premium services). NHK also runs 3 national radio services and a number of international radio and television services, akin to the BBC World Service. NHK has also been an innovator in television, developing the world's first high definition television technology in 1964 and launching high definition services in Japan in 1981.\n[3777815#1] Sesame Street (Japan) - \"Sesame Street\" has been one of NHK's most successful children's programs and one of the first to be imported from overseas. \"Sesame Street\" first aired on November 8, 1971, but was taken off the network in the early 1980s. It resumed from 1988 until the end of March 2004, when production on a local adaptation was announced, which NHK refused to be involved in. While \"Sesame Street\" is primarily designed for preschool children, teenagers and adults watched the program as a guide to learning English (though much later on, a dubbed version was available).\n[147797#3] NHK World-Japan - NHK commenced international TV broadcasting services for North America and Europe in 1995. On April 1, 1998, NHK World Television started broadcasting. NHK World Television is a news and information channel that broadcasts internationally via satellite and cable TV. Programming is broadcast in English. It began as a news channel in February 2009. Some of the shows are produced by production studio JIB TV which is 60% owned by NHK with the remaining 40% owned by private investors like Microsoft and Japanese bank Mizuho. The NHK World DOG is not used at all when shows produced by JIB TV are aired as a paid programming.\n[147782#29] NHK - Katsuto Momii (籾井勝人), 21st head of NHK, caused controversy by discussing Japan's actions in the Second World War at his first news conference after being appointed on 20 December 2013. It was reported Momii said NHK should support the Japanese government in its territorial dispute with China and South Korea. He also caused controversy by playing down the issue of the enforced sexual slavery of the so-called comfort women by the Japanese military in World War Two by, according to the \"Taipei Times\", stating \"[South] Korea's statements that Japan is the only nation that forced this are puzzling. 'Give us money, compensate us', they say, but since all of this was resolved by the Japan-Korea peace treaty, why are they reviving this issue? It’s strange.\" It was subsequently reported by the Japan Times that on his first day at NHK Momii asked members of the executive team to hand in their resignation on the grounds they had all been appointed by his predecessor.\n[147782#20] NHK - NHK opened the first stage of its current headquarters in the special ward of Japan's capital city Shibuya as an international broadcasting center for the 1964 Summer Olympics, the first widely televised Olympic Games. The complex was gradually expanded through 1973, when it became the headquarters for NHK. The previous headquarters adjacent to Hibiya Park was redeveloped as the Hibiya City high-rise complex.\n[15579#19] Communications in Japan - In the postwar period, NHK's budget and operations were under the purview of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Broadcasting Law of 1950 provides for independent management and programming by NHK. Television broadcasting began in 1953, and color television was introduced in 1960. Cable television was introduced in 1969. In 1978 an experimental broadcast satellite with two color television channels was launched. Operational satellites for television use were launched between 1984 and 1990. Television viewing spread so rapidly that, by 1987, 99 percent of Japan's households had color television sets and the average family had its set on at least five hours a day. Starting in 1987, NHK began full-scale experimental broadcasting on two channels using satellite-to-audience signals, thus bringing service to remote and mountainous parts of the country that earlier had experienced poor reception. The new system also provided twenty-four hours a day, nonstop service.\n[1397633#10] Kintetsu Liners - In 1960–1961 season, the first NHK Cup was held, which decides the No. 1 rugby club in Japan. Before that, university teams had been stronger than company teams in Japan. But after the World War II, many company teams were restarted or founded newly, and the company rugby were growing up. So Japan Rugby Football Union organized the NHK cup for three times from this season, and changed it to All-Japan Rugby Football Championship from 1963–1964 season.\n[20643032#5] Television in Japan - The Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai (NHK, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation) began conducting research to \"unlock the fundamental mechanism of video and sound interactions with the five human senses\" in 1964, after the Tokyo Olympics. NHK set out to create an HDTV system that ended up scoring much higher in subjective tests than NTSC's previously dubbed \"HDTV\". This new system, NHK Color, created in 1972, included 1125 lines, a 5:3 aspect ratio and 60 Hz refresh rate. The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), headed by Charles Ginsburg, became the testing and study authority for HDTV technology in the international theater. SMPTE would test HDTV systems from different companies from every conceivable perspective, but the problem of combining the different formats plagued the technology for many years.\n[147782#15] NHK - NHK's earliest forerunner was the founded in 1924 under the leadership of Count Gotō Shinpei. Tokyo Broadcasting Station, along with separate organizations in Osaka and Nagoya, began radio broadcasts in 1925. The three stations merged under the first incarnation of NHK in August 1926. NHK was modelled on the BBC of the United Kingdom, and the merger and reorganisation was carried out under the auspices of the pre-war Ministry of Communications. NHK's second radio network began in 1931, and the third radio network (FM) began in 1937.\n[147782#19] NHK - A new Broadcasting Act (\"Hōsō Hō\") was enacted in 1950, which made NHK a listener-supported independent corporation and simultaneously opened the market for commercial broadcasting in Japan. NHK started television broadcasting in the same year, followed by its Educational TV channel in 1959 and color television broadcasts in 1960.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

For the first three years of its existence it was an invisible currency, only used in accountancy. Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced the national banknotes and coins of the countries in eurozone 12, such as the Belgian franc and the Greek drachma.\n[9472#20] Euro - The currency was introduced in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU).

The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal tender until new notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002 (having been distributed in small amounts in the previous December). Beginning on 1 January 1999, all bonds and other forms of government debt by eurozone nations were denominated in euros.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What was the first newspaper ever printed in the U.K.?\n\nContexts: [36897421#2] Lögberg-Heimskringla - The very first newspaper to be published in North America by the Icelandic immigrant population was handwritten by Jon Gudmundsson in 1876, and was called \"Nýi Þjóðólfur\". In 1877, the first edition of a newspaper printed on a printing press, \"Framfari\" was published on September 1 at Lundi. The need for Icelandic language publications was felt keenly by the immigrants, who felt it important from the beginning to preserve both their language and their culture. This was followed by \"Leifur\" and several other publications.\n[1965416#2] The New York Times Magazine - Its first issue was published on September 6, 1896, and contained the first photographs ever printed in the newspaper. In the early decades it was a section of the broadsheet paper and not an insert as it is today. The creation of a \"serious\" Sunday magazine was part of a massive overhaul of the newspaper instigated that year by its new owner, Adolph Ochs, who also banned fiction, comic strips and gossip columns from the paper, and is generally credited with saving \"The New York Times\" from financial ruin. In 1897, the magazine published a 16-page spread of photographs documenting Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, a \"costly feat\" that resulted in a wildly popular issue and helped boost the magazine to success.\n[662134#6] Letterpress printing - Letterpress printing was introduced in Canada in 1752 in Halifax, Nova Scotia by John Bushell in the newspaper format. This paper was named the Halifax Gazette and became Canada's first newspaper. Bushell apprenticed under Bartholomew Green in Boston. Green moved to Halifax in 1751 in hopes of starting a newspaper, as it did not exist in the area. Two weeks and a day after the press he was going to use for this new project arrived in Halifax, Green died. Upon receiving word about what happened, Bushell moved to Halifax and continued what Green had started. The Halifax Gazette was first published on March 23, 1752, making Bushell the first letterpress printer in Halifax, and eventually Canada. There is only one known surviving copy which was found in the Massachusetts Historical Society.\n[22112840#19] Newspaper - In 1752, John Bushell published the \"Halifax Gazette\", which claims to be \"Canada's first newspaper.\" However, its official descendant, the \"Royal Gazette\", is a government publication for legal notices and proclamations rather than a proper newspaper; In 1764, the \"Quebec Gazette\" was first printed 21 June 1764 and remains the oldest continuously published newspaper in North America as the \"Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph\". It is currently published as an English-language weekly from its offices at 1040 Belvédère, suite 218, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. In 1808, the \"Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro\" had its first edition, printed in devices brought from England, publishing news favourable for the government of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves since it was produced by the official press service of the Portuguese crown.\n[30993324#3] Sunday magazine - In 1869, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" published what is regarded as the first Sunday magazine, and the \"Chicago Inter Ocean\" added color to its supplement. \"The New York Times Magazine\" was published on September 6, 1896, and it contained the first photographs ever printed in that newspaper. During the 1890s, publications were inserted into Joseph Pulitzer's \"New York World\" and William Randolph Hearst's \"New York Journal\". Hearst had the eight-page \"Women's Home Journal\" and the 16-page \"Sunday American Magazine\", which later became \"The American Weekly\". In November 1896, Morrill Goddard, editor of the \"New York Journal\" from 1896 to 1937, launched Hearst's Sunday magazine, later commenting, \"Nothing is so stale as yesterday's newspaper, but \"The American Weekly\" may be around the house for days or weeks and lose none of its interest.\"\n[45265915#81] Paris in the 18th century - The first daily newspaper in the city, the \"Journal de Paris\", began publication on 1 January 1777. It was four pages long, printed on small sheets of paper, and focused on local news, and what was allowed by the royal censors. The press did not emerge as a force in Parisian life until 1789 and the Revolution, when censorship was abolished. Serious publications, such as the \"Journal des Débats\" appeared, along with thousands of short pamphlets, addressing the current topics of the day, and often virulent in their language. The period of press freedom did not last for long; in 1792 Robespierre and the Jacobins restored censorship and closed opposition newspapers and printing houses. Strict censorship was retained by governments that followed. Freedom of the press was not restored until the second half of the 19th century.\n[3494738#103] History of American newspapers - The first Spanish-language newspapers in the United States were \"El Misisipí\" and \"El Mensagero Luisianés\", which began publication in New Orleans in 1808 and 1809. \"La Gaceta de Texas\" and \"El Mexicano\", the first newspapers in what is now considered the Southwest, were written and typeset in Nacogdoches, Texas but printed in Natchitoches, Louisiana in 1813. They supported the Mexican independence movement.\n[44607#5] History of British newspapers - At the beginning of the 17th century, the right to print was strictly controlled in England. This was probably the reason why the first newspaper in the English language was printed in Rome by Joris Veseler around 1620. This followed the style established by Veseler's earlier Dutch paper \"Courante uyt Italien, Duytslandt, &c.\" However, when the English started printing their own papers in London, they reverted to the pamphlet format used by contemporary books. The publication of these newsbooks was suspended between 1632 and 1638 by order of the Star Chamber. After they resumed publication, the era of these newsbooks lasted until the publication of the \"Oxford Gazette\" in 1665.\n[1821883#2] American Antiquarian Society - The collections of the AAS contain over three million books, pamphlets, newspapers, periodicals, graphic arts materials and manuscripts. The Society is estimated to hold copies of two-thirds of the total books known to have been printed in what is now the United States from the establishment of the first press in 1640 through the year 1820; many of these volumes are exceedingly rare and a number of them are unique. Historic materials from all fifty U.S. states, most of Canada and the British West Indies are included in the AAS repository. One of the more famous volumes held by the Society is a copy of the very first book printed in America, the Bay Psalm Book. AAS also has one of the largest collections of newspapers printed in America through 1876, with more than two million issues in its collection.\n[15928#15] Journalism - As mass-printing technologies like the printing press spread, newspapers were established to provide increasingly literate audiences with news. The first references to privately-owned newspaper publishers in China date to the late Ming dynasty in 1582. Johann Carolus's \"Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien\", published in 1605 in Strassburg, is often recognized as the first newspaper in Europe. The first successful English daily, the \"Daily Courant\", was published from 1702 to 1735. While journalistic enterprises were started as private ventures in some regions, such as The Holy Roman Empire and the British Empire, other countries such as France and Prussia kept tighter control of the press, treating it primarily as an outlet for government propaganda and subjecting it to uniform censorship. Other governments, such as the Russian Empire, were even more distrusting of journalistic press and effectively banned journalistic publications until the mid-19th century. As newspaper publication became a more and more established practice, publishers would increase publication to a weekly or daily rate. Newspapers were more heavily concentrated in cities that were centers of trade, such as Amsterdam, London, and Berlin. The first newspapers in Latin America would be established in the mid-to-late 19th century.\n[22112840#15] Newspaper - The emergence of the new media in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the spread of the printing press from which the publishing press derives its name. The German-language \"Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien\", printed from 1605 onwards by Johann Carolus in Strasbourg, is often recognized as the first newspaper. At the time, Strasbourg was a free imperial city in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation; the first newspaper of modern Germany was the \"Avisa\", published in 1609 in Wolfenbüttel.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: How many copies did Salem's Lot sell?\n\nContexts: [44597215#11] Salem (Vosper painting) - By 1933 the painting was famous enough to be the subject of a notable article in the Welsh language magazine \"Y Ford Gron\" (The Round Table) and by 1937, \"Salem\" gained yet more popularity when Sir Ifan ab Owen Edwards sold thousands of prints to supporters of the Urdd Gobaith Cymru for 6d. By 1942 it was described by \"Yr Aelwyd\" as \"One of the most beautiful pictures of the religious life of Wales in old times\" and in 1950, 1956 and 1957 many more Welsh households obtained copies when the picture was used in the Cymru Fydd calendar. By the 1960s, the painting was famous throughout Wales and was ubiquitous in many Welsh communities.\n[18691665#19] Sanaʽa - Sanaʽa was chosen as the 2004 Arab Cultural Capital by the Arab League. In 2008, the Al Saleh Mosque was completed. It holds over 40,000 worshipers.\n[28358173#6] Salem Gazette - In 2006 the \"Salem Gazette\" was resurrected under the banner of GateHouse Media, and currently operates as a free weekly newspaper focusing on culture, daily life and human interest in Salem. New editions of the paper are distributed on Fridays. The paper prints approximately 13,000 copies per week. The first editor of the new Salem Gazette was Bill Woolley, followed by Lisa Guerriero, current editor of the \"Melrose Free Press\". Since 2011, the editor of the \"Salem Gazette\" has been Sarah Thomas.\n[148731#16] The Cat in the Hat - According to Judith and Neil Morgan, the book sold well immediately. The trade edition initially sold an average of 12,000 copies a month, a figure which rose rapidly. Bullock's department store in Los Angeles, California, sold out of its first, 100-copy order of the book in a day and quickly reordered 250 more. The Morgans attribute these sales numbers to \"playground word-of-mouth\", asserting that children heard about the book from their friends and nagged their parents to buy it for them. However, Houghton Mifflin's school edition did not sell as well. As Geisel noted in Jonathan Cott's 1983 profile of him, \"Houghton Mifflin... had trouble selling it to the schools; there were a lot of Dick and Jane devotees, and my book was considered too fresh and irreverent. But Bennett Cerf at Random House had asked for trade rights, and it just took off in the bookstores.\" Geisel told the Morgans, \"Parents understood better than school people the necessity for this kind of reader.\"\n[75813#8] Crisis on Infinite Earths - Wolfman said when he pitched the series to DC, he realized it was going to be a completely new beginning for the DCU. \"I knew up front, and they did too, how big this was going to be,\" he said. \"But, no-one knew how well it would sell, or whether it would sell at all. It was a risk DC was willing to take, because my thoughts were that DC needed a lot of help at that time, and they did too.\" Wolfman also said he saw it as an attempt to improve DC's reputation for storytelling. Many readers at the time saw them as old fashioned.\n[395037#10] 'Salem's Lot - Politics during the time influenced King's writing of the story. The corruption in the government was a significant factor in the inspiration of the story. Of this he recalls,\nIn 2005, Centipede Press released a deluxe limited edition of \"'Salem's Lot\" with black and white photographs by Jerry Uelsmann and the two short stories \"Jerusalem's Lot\" and \"One for the Road\", as well as over 50 pages of deleted material. The book was limited to 315 copies, each signed by Stephen King and Jerry Uelsmann. The book was printed on 100# Mohawk Superfine paper, it measured , was over thick, and weighed more than . The book included a ribbon marker, head and tail bands, three-piece cloth construction, and a slipcase. An unsigned hardcover edition limited to 600 copies, was later released. Both the signed and unsigned editions were sold out. In an interview with the printed trade journal \"Fine Books & Collections\", King said of the illustrated folio version of his \"'Salem's Lot\", \"I think it's beautiful!\" A trade edition was later released.\n[41959688#0] Winfield Toll Bridge - Winfield Toll Bridge, also known as the Ross Booth Memorial Bridge, is a historic three-span cantilever Warren Truss bridge located at Winfield and Red House, Putnam County, West Virginia. It was built in 1955, and spans the Kanawha River, carrying West Virginia Route 34. The cantilever through-truss consists of two anchor spans each 245 feet in length and the main span 462 feet in length between pier center lines. The main span consists of two 128 feet, 4 inch, cantilever arms and a 205 feet, 4 inch, suspended span.\n[839579#8] Slay Tracks: 1933–1969 - Shortly after its release, \"Slay Tracks\" became a collector's item. According to an April 1990 Drag City press release, copies were typically sold for $500–$600. Malkmus and Kannberg each kept 100 copies of the EP, and Malkmus said \"I used to sell them for fifty dollars. When I needed money I'd go in and sell a couple to the store and they'd sell for a hundred dollars each. I rarely meet anyone who bought it when it originally came out.\" Malkmus also said that the pair \"probably gave away about one-hundred to friends and bands we later toured with.\" The songs on \"Slay Tracks\" found airplay on several college radio stations, including University of Virginia's WTJU and University of California, Berkeley's KALX. Kannberg commented on the EP's unanticipated popularity, saying \"It was very surprising to find that people were into [\"Slay Tracks\"].\"\n[53068776#13] Tajemnica Statuetki - Sales exceeded the estimates of IPS and the expectations of the creators themselves. Chmielarz sold between 4,000 and 6,000 copies by mail at a time when just a thousand or two thousand units was considered a major achievement. Even foreign Western hits had rarely achieved that level of sales. Additionally, the market was still dominated by rampant piracy. At a time where democracy and capitalism were just being introduced to Poland and in which The Software Protection Act was just being created – coming into effect in 1994 – players were not used to paying high amounts for original not-bootlegged games. Polish developers had become accustomed to players pirating their games, and continued to spend months on titles despite little return. According to Chmielarz, the main reason for this cultural landscape was the commodity exchange which he himself came from, and he was very critical about pirates, particular those who had tried to hack his own game. One such example is CSL, who had been publicly highlighted by \"Gambler\" magazine as the \"'best' Polish hacker\" for cracking \"Tajemnica statuetki\" among other titles. Nevertheless, despite the game being frequently pirated, a sizable number of units were sold legally. Part of the reason is that CSL had only completed a partial hack, leaving some copy protection codes unbroken, a fact discovered by Chmielarz upon testing. \"SS-NG\" (\"Secret Service - Next Generation\") puts \"Tajemnica Statuetki\"'s success in a piracy-prone market to it being reasonably cheap and comparable to English-language adventure games. Due to the difficulty of the game, particularly a puzzle set when the protagonist is trying to escape from prison, Chmielarz received incessant calls from players who stuck unable to move on; he would have to explain the \"absurd\" solution over the phone. Just with the profits of those initial sales, he was able to keep Metropolis Software running for two years without financial difficulty. \"SS-NG\" notes that its contemporaries had begun making games for 8-bit computers, which freed up the market for Metropolis Software to pursue PC game development without competition. The game's success gave the development team enough faith to put everything else aside in creating the next game. They planned for this next title to follow in the footsteps of its success, being competitive not only in Poland but also in foreign countries. As the game sold well, both players and reviewers eagerly awaited the next offering from this young studio. The studio had set the bar very high with \"Tajemnica Statuetki\", and so to avoid half-measures being taken, graphic designers, animators and testers were hired.\n[38358079#15] Spectrum SportsNet LA - In September 2016, after acquiring TWC, Charter indicated it would price the 2017 season above $4.50. “[The previous] deal is no longer on the table—it didn’t work,” said Charter Chief Executive Thomas Rutledge to the \"Los Angeles Times\". “We would love to sell the channel to others, but no one has bought it—and we are not giving it away. So if consumers want the Dodger channel, they’ll need to subscribe to us to get it.”\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: How many people are employed by the company G4S?\n\nContexts: [284758#14] G4S - On 12 July 2012, it was announced that 3,500 British troops would be deployed at the 2012 Summer Olympics due to a shortage of adequately trained G4S security staff, with Labour MP Keith Vaz claiming that, \"G4S has let the country down and we have literally had to send in the troops\". Shares in G4S later dropped 9 percent after the firm claimed it faced a possible £50 million loss as a result of failing to provide sufficient trained staff for the 2012 Olympic Games. On 17 July, the company's chief executive, Nick Buckles, appeared before the Home Affairs Select Committee, where he apologised for the organisational failings, expressed regret at having taken on the Olympic security contract, and agreed in principle to pay bonuses to soldiers drafted at the last moment as replacement security staff. Pressed by Labour MP David Winnick, he was forced to admit that organisational situation had become a \"humiliating shambles\".\n[26322119#4] Patrick Norton - On March 25, 2004, Comcast's G4 gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV. This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV. Around May 6, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 10, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4's main office in Los Angeles, California if they agreed to relocate there. Norton chose to stay in San Francisco instead of moving to Los Angeles, and left the company.\n[1586498#13] Y-12 National Security Complex - CNS Y-12 currently employs approximately 4,700 people. About 1,500 additional personnel work onsite as employees of organizations that include UT-Battelle, Science Applications International Corporation, Bechtel Jacobs, UCOR, and WSI Oak Ridge (an American-controlled unit of G4S Secure Solutions), which holds the security contract for the site.\n[57499293#2] Barry Dodd - He formed GSM with a colleague from his days at ICI in 1974. The company specialises in labels and barcoding equipment, sheet metal assemblies and automotive components. Through many acquisitions, the company employed over 400 people at nine sites across the United Kingdom by the time of Dodd's death.\n[42855234#1] G4S Gurkha Services - Gurkha Services was formed in 2007 and employed 600 people as of November 2011. In the north east of England they were hired in an attempt to reduce metal theft from railways.\n[50677561#41] Controversies surrounding G4S - Justice secretary Liz Truss informed Members of Parliament that insufficient staffing lay at the root of the Birmingham riot. She said G4S would have to pay the costs of ten highly trained public sector Tornado elite teams dispatched to end the 12-hour riot at its Birmingham prison. Three hundred and eighty prisoners were transferred from wrecked wings of the prison to other jails across England, but their dispersal led to two incidents at HM Prison Hull on Sunday and another at HM Prison Cardiff and yet another at HM Prison Swaleside. At the riot's start, prisoners took keys from a G4S guard. At 10:00 a.m. G4S deployed two Tornado teams but that response was insufficient. Seven public sector Tornado teams were therefore necessarily dispatched to Birmingham at 11:29 a.m. “Shortly after 10 p.m., the teams had secured all four wings,\" she said. Labour MPs pressed Truss over whether prior warnings from the Birmingham independent monitoring board had been acted upon, and about the consequences of a 700 million pound budget cut and the reduction of 7,000 prison officers on the overall stability of the Prison Service. Labour said the riot should prompt the government to review the operation of prisons by private companies such as G4S and Serco. Although Truss repeatedly refused to acknowledge if she had read the Birmingham prison watchdog’s October report that warned of the need for urgent action to tackle understaffing and the spread of psychoactive drugs, she said they had been discussed with the prison's governor. The Truss statement followed still another warning from John Thornhill, the president of the independent monitoring board. He said insufficient staff had caused rising levels of violence in prisons in England and Wales: “It is the board’s view, echoed by prison staff, that there are insufficient staff numbers to deal with many of the day-to-day situations that occur in a local prison… The result, as we have seen in recent weeks, is an increase in riots that damage the system.” “The impact of this unrestrained violence is that a large number of prisoners have to be transferred to other prisons that are already stretched with their own problems and staffing issues.”\n[9132239#4] Třinec Iron and Steel Works - It is the main employer in the area, with the Iron and Steel Works employing 5,519 people in 2005. The number of permanently employed workers has historically been declining, numbering 9,276 people in 1998, while during the communist era more than 15,000 worked there. The actual number of people working for TŽ is still somewhat higher, as many people are employed seasonally in brigade work and in affiliated facilities. The company is the main sponsor of the local ice hockey team HC Oceláři Třinec (Třinec Steelers).\n[284758#2] G4S - It is the world's largest security company measured by revenues and has operations in more than 90 countries. With over 570,000 employees, it is the world's third-largest private employer, the largest European and African private employer, and among the largest on the London Stock Exchange. G4S was founded in 2004 by the merger of the UK-based Securicor plc with the Denmark-based Group 4 Falck.\n[572831#1] G4 (U.S. TV channel) - In late 2012, G4's studio programming ceased in preparation for its relaunch as Esquire Network on September 23, 2013, as part of a licensing deal with Hearst Corporation, owner of \"Esquire\" magazine. However, on September 9, 2013, NBCUniversal announced that Esquire Network would instead replace sister channel, Style, leaving G4 \"as is for the foreseeable future, though it's highly unlikely the company will invest in more original programming\". In August 2013, it was reported that approximately 61,217,000 American households (53.61% of households with television) were receiving G4, though this declined with later removals by several cable services as carriage agreements expired.\n[186616#34] Wetzlar - The city is home to some internationally active and well known enterprises. The Buderus company was created in the year 1731 and is one of the oldest still existing (large) enterprises. As BBT Thermotechnik, now part of the Bosch group, Buderus was for many decades one of the largest employers in the central Hessian area with more than 10,000 persons employed in Wetzlar alone (worldwide over 16,000), working in the areas casting (with cement), high-grade steel and heating technologies. Economic changes, repeated shifts of the stock majority as well as close-downs and sales of various divisions have strongly changed the company in the meantime. However, it ranks among the largest enterprises in Hesse. Wetzlar is apart from Jena and Oberkochen a German centre for optics as well as the most important German location for the precision engineering industry. The manufactured products have gained worldwide reputation. One of the most important companies in the area of microscopy is Leica Microsystems (formerly known as Ernst Leitz), which in its peak times employed over 7000 people in the city. Small format (35 mm) photography was invented in Wetzlar, and Leica cameras are well known for their excellent quality. In addition there are cameras of the companies Leidolf and Minox, binoculars and telescopes made by the company Hensoldt AG (now Carl Zeiss), part of the Zeiss group (over 2,000 people employed in peak times). Other well-known firms are Philips (with about 1,200 employed at times) or Siemens AG and Siemens VDO, since 2007 Continental AG or the Sancura BKK, a supraregional health insurance company, which is combined with the Taunus BKK. The Business park \"Spilburg\", former barracks, became home to a number of innovative enterprises, particularly in the area of optics/precision mechanics, information technology and services. Additionally, areas in the \"Westend\" as well as the \"Hörnsheimer Eck\" and the \"Dillfeld\" are available for new businesses to set up.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: What was Megan Fox's first film role?\n\nContexts: [1769827#12] Megan Fox - In 2012, Fox appeared briefly in Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy \"The Dictator\" and had a featured role in Judd Apatow's comedy \"This Is 40\". She was the voice of Lois Lane in the film \"Robot Chicken DC Comics Special\", an episode of the television comedy series \"Robot Chicken\", and it aired as a one-off special during Cartoon Network's Adult Swim on September 9, 2012.\n[1769827#9] Megan Fox - In 2009, Fox had her first lead role since the \"Transformers\" series; she portrayed the title character in \"Jennifer's Body\", written by Academy Award–winning screenwriter Diablo Cody. In April 2009, she began filming \"Jonah Hex\", in which she portrayed Leila (Tallulah Black), a gun-wielding beauty and Jonah Hex's (Josh Brolin) love interest. The film was released on June 18, 2010. Despite receiving top billing, Fox described her role in the film as being a cameo. \"Jonah Hex\" was a critical and commercial failure in the U.S., with its international distribution cancelled after its poor performance. The film was named the \"worst picture of the year\" by the Houston Film Critics Society.\n[1769827#26] Megan Fox - The increased media exposure was difficult for Fox, who acknowledged being shy and insecure, to adjust to. It also positioned her as a potential role model, and later led to her being typecast. She rejected being a formal role model, but said that she could make young girls feel \"strong and intelligent and be outspoken and fight for what they think is right\" and that she was a different role model for girls that maybe America was not comfortable with. She considered being typecast as attractive an opportunity to surprise people when she gives a good performance in a film, but said she is interested in portraying less sexualized characters. MTV's Craig Flaster said that although Fox has \"been typecast as the big-budget sex symbol\", she has shown comedic range.\n[1769827#0] Megan Fox - Megan Denise Fox (born May 16, 1986) is an American actress and model. She began her acting career in 2001, with several minor television and film roles, and played a regular role on the \"Hope & Faith\" television sitcom. In 2004, she made her film debut with a role in the teen comedy \"Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen\". In 2007, she co-starred as Mikaela Banes, the love interest of Shia LaBeouf's character, in the blockbuster action film \"Transformers\", which became her breakout role. Fox reprised her role in the 2009 sequel, \"\". Later in 2009, she starred as the eponymous lead in the black comedy horror film \"Jennifer's Body\". In 2014, Fox starred as April O'Neil in \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", and reprised the role in \"\" (2016).\n[1769827#13] Megan Fox - In January 2013, Fox was featured in a Brazilian television commercial for Brahma beer. In February 2013, Fox set aside her differences with her former director Michael Bay and worked again with him on his reboot of \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (2014). In October 2014, Fox was cast as the female lead in James Franco's film adaptation of \"Zeroville\". In 2015, Fox was cast in the role of Amelia Delthanis in the Plarium video game, \"Stormfall: Rise of Balur\".\n[55852107#0] List of awards and nominations received by Megan Fox - Megan Fox is an American actress and model who rose to prominence with her role in the 2007 science fiction film \"Transformers\". Since then, Fox has received various awards and nominations, including four Teen Choice Awards and two Scream Awards. Due to poor performances in films, she has been nominated for several Golden Raspberry Awards and earned one.\n[1769827#6] Megan Fox - In 2004, she made her film debut in \"Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen\" co-starring opposite Lindsay Lohan, playing the supporting role of Carla Santini, a rival of Lola (Lohan). Fox was also cast in a regular role on the ABC sitcom \"Hope & Faith\", in which she portrayed Sydney Shanowski, replacing Nicole Paggi. Fox appeared in seasons 2 to 3, until the show was cancelled by ABC in May 2006.\n[25001260#9] Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Megan Fox was originally attached to the film, and Patrick Dempsey's role as Dylan Gould was to be the employer of Fox's character, Mikaela Banes. According to various published sources, Fox's absence from the film was due to Bay ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing him and his work ethics to Adolf Hitler, although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise. Bay later claimed that Fox was fired by executive producer Steven Spielberg, a claim which Spielberg denied. \"I wasn't hurt\", Bay stated, \"because I know that's just Megan. Megan loves to get a response. And she does it in kind of the wrong way. I'm sorry, Megan. I'm sorry I made you work twelve hours. I'm sorry that I'm making you show up on time. Movies are not always warm and fuzzy.\"\n[1769827#7] Megan Fox - In 2007, Fox won the lead female role of Mikaela Banes in the 2007 live-action film \"Transformers\", based on the toy and cartoon saga of the same name. Fox played the love interest of Shia LaBeouf's character Sam Witwicky. Fox was nominated for an MTV Movie Award in the category of \"Breakthrough Performance\", and was also nominated for three Teen Choice Awards. She had signed on for two more \"Transformers\" sequels, reprising her role as Mikaela in \"\". There was some controversy surrounding Fox's appearance while filming the sequel when Michael Bay, the film's director, ordered the actress to gain 10 pounds. The film was released worldwide on June 24, 2009.\n[1769827#5] Megan Fox - At 15, Fox made her acting debut in the 2001 film \"Holiday in the Sun\", as spoiled heiress Brianna Wallace and rival of Alex Stewart (Ashley Olsen), which was released direct-to-DVD on November 20, 2001.

    "prompt": "Question: What countries made up ancient Persia?\n\nContexts: [952063#1] Iranian religions - The beliefs, activities, and cultural events of the ancient Iranians in ancient Iran are complex matters. The ancient Iranians made references to a combination of several Aryans and non-Aryan tribes. Aryans, or ancient Iranians, worshiped natural elements such as the sun, sunlight and thunder, but they eventually shifted their attention mostly to a single god, whilst acknowledging others. The Iranian ancient prophet, Zoroaster, reformed Iranian religious beliefs to a form of Henotheism. The Gathas, hymns of Zoroaster's Avesta, brought monotheistic ideas to Persia, while through the Yashts and Yasna, mentions are made to Polytheism and earlier creeds. The Vedas and the Avesta have both served researchers as important resources in discovering early Aryan beliefs and ideas.Some religionists made syncretic teachings of Islam and local Zoroastrianism.\n[1275748#65] Muslim conquest of Persia - The Arab conquest of Persia led to a period of extreme urbanisation in Iran, starting with the ascension of the Abbasid dynasty and ending in the 11th century CE. This was particularly true for the eastern parts of the country, for regions like Khorasan and Transoxiana. During this period, Iran saw the development of massive metropolises, some reaching population numbers of up to 200,000 people. Before this period, the important Persian cities had been situated outside of Persia proper, especially in Mesopotamia. This period of extreme urbanisation was followed in the 11th century by a collapse of the Iranian economy, which led to large scale emigrations of Iranians into Central Asia, India, the rest of the Middle East, and Anatolia. This catastrophe has been cited by some as reason for the Persian language becoming widespread throughout Central Asia and large parts of the Middle East.\n[141013#60] Arthur de Gobineau - Gobineau saw Persia as a land without a future that was destined to be conquered by the West sooner or later, which for him was a tragedy for the West as he believed that Western men would all too easily be seduced by the beautiful Persian women, thus causing more miscegenation to further \"corrupt\" the West. However, Gobineau was obsessed with ancient Persia, seeing in Achaemenid Persia a great and glorious Aryan civilization, now sadly gone, that was to preoccupy him for the rest of his life. Gobineau loved to visit the ruins of Achaemenid period as his mind was fundamentally backward looking, preferring to contemplate past glories rather what he saw as a dismal present and even bleaker future. Gobineau's time in Persia inspired two books, \"Mémoire sur l'etat social de la Perse actuelle\" (1858) and \"Trois ans en Asie\" (1859). Through Gobineau was less than complimentary about modern Persia, writing to Prokesch-Osten that there was no \"Persian race\" as modern Persians were \"a breed mixed from God knows what!\", but he loved ancient Persia as the great Aryan civilization par excellence, noting that Iran means \"the land of the Aryans\" in Farsi. Gobineau was less Euro-centric than one might expect in his writings on Persia, believing that the origins of European civilization could be traced to Persia and criticized western scholars for their \"collective vanity\" in being unable to admit to the West's \"huge\" debt to Persia.\n[448049#0] Fars Province - Pars Province (; , \"Ostān-e Pārs\", ) also known as Fars (, \"Fārs\") or Persia in the Greek sources in historical context, is one of the thirty-one provinces of Iran and known as the cultural capital of the country. It is in the south of the country, in Iran's Region 2, and its administrative center is Shiraz. It has an area of 122,400 km². In 2011, this province had a population of 4.6 million people, of which 67.6% were registered as urban dwellers (urban/suburbs), 32.1% villagers (small town/rural), and 0.3% nomad tribes. The etymology of the word \"Persian\" (From Latin \"Persia\", from Ancient Greek , \"Persís\"), found in many ancient names associated with Iran, is derived from the historical importance of this region. Fars Province is the original homeland of the Persian people.\n[33191133#9] Rhinoceroses in ancient China - During the Tang Dynasty a number of rhinoceroses were presented to the imperial court from south-east Asian countries, including Champa, Chinrap, and Kalinga, as well as Tibet and a country named as Persia. At least some of these rhinoceroses were specimens of the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros (\"Rhinoceros unicornis\"). Performing elephants and rhinoceroses took part in the entertainments for Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (reigned 712–756).\n[3180403#11] Battle of Nahāvand - On the long-term impact of this battle, Sir Muhammad Iqbal wrote: \"If you ask me what is the most important event in the history of Islam, I shall say without any hesitation: “The Conquest of Persia.” The battle of Nehawand gave the Arabs not only a beautiful country, but also an ancient civilization; or, more properly, a people who could make a new civilisation with the Semitic and Aryan material. Our Muslim civilisation is a product of the cross-fertilisation of the Semitic and the Aryan ideas. It is a child who inherits the softness and refinement of his Aryan mother, and the sterling character of his Semitic father. But for the conquest of Persia, the civilisation of Islam would have been one-sided. The conquest of Persia gave us what the conquest of Greece gave to the Romans.\"\n[3092592#3] Iranian Armenians - Since Antiquity there has always been much interaction between Ancient Armenia and Persia (Iran). The Armenian people are amongst the native ethnic groups of northwestern Iran (known as Iranian Azerbaijan), having millennia long recorded history there while the region (or parts of it) have had made up part of historical Armenia numerous times in history. These historical Armenian regions that nowadays include Iranian Azerbaijan are Nor Shirakan, Vaspurakan, and Paytakaran. Many of the oldest Armenian chapels, monasteries and churches in the world are located within this region of Iran.\n[3830344#6] Germany–Iran relations - Reza Shah went on to ask the international community to use the native name of \"Iran\" in 1935 to address to his country. Although the country has been known as Iran to the native people themselves for many centuries, Westerners came to know the nation as Persia through ancient Greek accounts. The goal was to distract attention from the traditional Western designation “Persia” (a term Greek in origin). “Persian” was the historical name of one of the ethnic groups in Iran. With the reforms Reza Shah was implementing, the adoption of a new name for the country was seen as restoring Iran’s historical legacy. While Persia had fallen victim to imperialism, Iran would be free from foreign control.\n[92016#16] Persepolis - In 316 BC, Persepolis was still the capital of Persia as a province of the great Macedonian Empire (see Diod. xix, 21 seq., 46; probably after Hieronymus of Cardia, who was living about 326). The city must have gradually declined in the course of time. The lower city at the foot of the imperial city might have survived for a longer time; but the ruins of the Achaemenids remained as a witness to its ancient glory. It is probable that the principal town of the country, or at least of the district, was always in this neighborhood.\n[66540#20] Ancient Greece - The Persians were defeated by a primarily Athenian naval force at the Battle of Salamis, and in 479 defeated on land at the Battle of Plataea. The alliance against Persia continued, initially led by the Spartan Pausanias but from 477 by Athens, and by 460 Persia had been driven out of the Aegean. During this period of campaigning, the Delian league gradually transformed from a defensive alliance of Greek states into an Athenian empire, as Athens' growing naval power enabled it to compel other league states to comply with its policies. Athens ended its campaigns against Persia in 450 BC, after a disastrous defeat in Egypt in 454 BC, and the death of Cimon in action against the Persians on Cyprus in 450.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.

    "prompt": "Question: When was the International Court of Justice formed?\n\nContexts: [14918#1] International Court of Justice - Established in 1945 by the UN Charter, the court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The Statute of the International Court of Justice, similar to that of its predecessor, is the main constitutional document constituting and regulating the court.\n[24960#14] Permanent Court of International Justice - The Court was unable to meet between 1941 and 1944, but the framework remained intact, and it soon became apparent that the Court would be dissolved. In 1943, an international panel met to consider \"the question of the Permanent Court of International Justice\", meeting from 20 March to 10 February 1944. The panel agreed that the name and functioning of the Court should be preserved but for some future court rather than a continuation of the current one. Between 21 August and 7 October 1944, the Dumbarton Oaks Conference was held, which, among other things, created an international court attached to the United Nations, to succeed the Permanent Court of International Justice. As a result of these conferences and others, the judges of the Permanent Court of International Justice officially resigned in October 1945 and, via a resolution by the League of Nations on 18 April 1946, the Court and the League both ceased to exist, being replaced by the International Court of Justice and the United Nations.\n[24960#0] Permanent Court of International Justice - The Permanent Court of International Justice, often called the World Court, existed from 1922 to 1946. It was an international court attached to the League of Nations. Created in 1920 (although the idea of an international court was several centuries old), the Court was initially well-received from states and academics alike, with many cases submitted to it for its first decade of operation. With the heightened international tension of the 1930s, the Court became less used. By a resolution from the League of Nations on 18 April 1946, the Court and the League both ceased to exist and were replaced by the International Court of Justice and the United Nations.\n[24960#4] Permanent Court of International Justice - The Court first sat on 30 January 1922, at the Peace Palace, The Hague, covering preliminary business during the first session (such as establishing procedure and appointing officers) Nine judges sat, along with three deputies, since Antonio Sánchez de Bustamante y Sirven, Ruy Barbosa and Wang Ch'ung-hui were unable to attend, the last being at the Washington Naval Conference. The Court elected Bernard Loder as President and Max Huber as Vice-President; Huber was replaced by Charles Andre Weiss a month later. On 14 February the Court was officially opened, and rules of procedure were established on 24 March, when the court ended its first session. The court first sat to decide cases on 15 June. During its first year of business, the Court issued three advisory opinions, all related to the International Labour Organization created by the Treaty of Versailles.\n[45690415#0] World's Court League - The World Court League was formed on December 30, 1915, with John Hays Hammond as president. They lobbied for the formation of the International Court of Justice.\n[24960#3] Permanent Court of International Justice - An international court had long been proposed; Pierre Dubois suggested it in 1305 and Émeric Crucé in 1623. An idea of an international court of justice arose in the political world at the First Hague Peace Conference in 1899, where it was declared that arbitration between states was the easiest solution to disputes, providing a temporary panel of judges to arbitrate in such cases, the Permanent Court of Arbitration. At the Second Hague Peace Conference in 1907, a draft convention for a permanent Court of Arbitral Justice was written although disputes and other pressing business at the Conference meant that such a body was never established, owing to difficulties agreeing on a procedure to select the judges. The outbreak of the First World War, and, in particular, its conclusion made it clear to many academics that some kind of world court was needed, and it was widely expected that one would be established. Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, created after the Treaty of Versailles, allowed the League to investigate setting up an international court. In June 1920, an Advisory Committee of jurists appointed by the League of Nations finally established a working guideline for the appointment of judges, and the Committee was then authorised to draft a constitution for a permanent court not of arbitration but of justice. The Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice was accepted in Geneva on December 13, 1920.\n[1780651#19] High Court (Ireland) - The current High Court is the fourth court in Ireland to bear that name. The first High Court – the High Court of Justice in Ireland – was created by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877. This fused the administration of common law and equity in Ireland (as had been done in England several years earlier under the Judicature Acts). The existing four superior courts, the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), Court of Chancery, Court of Exchequer, and Court of Common Pleas were merged to form the High Court of Justice, although they remained as divisions of the new court, and the building which housed them is called the Four Courts to this day. However, in Ireland, the divisions of the High Court other than the King's Bench Division and Chancery Division were abolished by 1907. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 split the court in separate courts for Northern Ireland (the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland and the High Court of Justice in Southern Ireland). Judges of the existing Court became judges of the Southern Ireland court unless they elected otherwise. With the enactment of the Constitution of the Irish Free State, the High Court became the \"High Court of Justice in Saorstát Éireann\".\n[2007738#25] Bahá'í divisions - In deciding when and how the International Bahá'í Council would develop into the Universal House of Justice, the Hands agreed to carry out Shoghi Effendi's plans for moving it from the appointed council, to an officially recognized Bahá'í Court, to a duly elected body, and then to the elected Universal House of Justice. In November 1959, referring to the goal of becoming recognized as a non-Jewish religious court in Israel, they said: \"this goal, due to the strong trend towards the secularization of Religious Courts in this part of the world, might not be achieved.\" The recognition as a religious court was never achieved, and the International Bahá'í Council was reformed in 1961 as an elected body in preparation for forming the Universal House of Justice. The Hands of the Cause made themselves ineligible for election to both the council and the Universal House of Justice.\n[31769#35] United Nations - The International Court of Justice (ICJ), located in The Hague, in the Netherlands, is the primary judicial organ of the UN. Established in 1945 by the UN Charter, the Court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The ICJ is composed of 15 judges who serve 9-year terms and are appointed by the General Assembly; every sitting judge must be from a different nation.\n[34407907#42] The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya - The International Criminal Court (ICC) became involved in Kenya when Kenya ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on 15 March 2005, which gave the ICC jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed in Kenya after the statute came into force, or July 2002. The ICC has jurisdiction only when the country in question fails to act on crimes against humanity that were perpetrated on its land. \nThe Kenyan government created the Commission of Inquiry on Post Election Violence (CIPEV), otherwise known as the Waki Commission, in February 2008, which was an international commission of inquiry with the aim of investigating the post-election violence that occurred in Kenya. One of the many suggestions in the official report that the Waki Commission made was that the Kenyan government establish a tribunal of both international and national judges to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of the gross human rights violations. The commission gave the government a limited amount of time to agree to create a special tribunal, and made it clear that the commission would give its findings to the ICC if the government failed to establish the tribunal within the given timeframe.\nIn February 2009, after the Kenyan Parliament voted against founding the tribunal and no further action was taken by the government, the Waki Commission handed over its information, including a list of those believed to be responsible for the violence, to the ICC. On 26 November 2009, the Prosecutor requested permission from the court to investigate the crimes against humanity during the post-election violence in Kenya, and was granted permission to do so by the majority of the court.\nAfter carrying out investigations against six prominent individuals believed to be responsible for the crimes against humanity, the International Criminal Court investigation in Kenya decided to send four of them to trial. The government has protested the findings. It asked the UN to postpone the ICC's Kenya case, and has put up substantial resistance to the ICC.\nIn addition, confidence in Kenya's judiciary has declined, and, as part of the National Accord made after the 2008 violence, the government has responded by launching an investigation into the judiciary. Four senior judges, Justice Samuel Bosire, Justice Joseph Gregory Nyamu, Justice Samuel Cornelius Riaga Omolo, and Justice Emmanuel Okelo O'Kubasu, were declared unfit for office by the investigation in April 2012. The two senior Court of Appeals judges, Justice Bosire and Justice Nyamu, were removed from office because of their involvement with the Goldenberg scandal trials. It is expected that more judges will be removed from office as the investigation continues. This ruling marks the beginning of the second phase of the vetting process, and the investigation may end the corruption in Kenya's own legal system.\n\nInstruction: Provide an answer to the question using the information provided in contexts written in English.
