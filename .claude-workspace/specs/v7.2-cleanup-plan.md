**Version**: 7.2.0
**Status**: Complete
**Created**: 2026-01-03
**Author**: Claude Development Team

## Summary

V7.2 focuses on housekeeping: cleaning build artifacts, verifying temp file status, and addressing any remaining documentation gaps from the v7 benchmark implementation.

---

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Safe Cleanup (No User Input Required)

These are auto-generated artifacts that can be safely removed:

| Task | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Clean `__pycache__` directories | Project-wide (excl. .venv) | Complete |
| Clean `.pytest_cache` directories | 3 locations | Complete |
| Clean `.coverage` files | 1 file | Complete |

### Phase 2: Verification (Report Findings)

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Verify temp/ directory | Check if temp files from v7 work still exist or were already cleaned | Complete - does not exist |
| Verify deliverables/ | Check if UAT packages need to be created | Complete - exists but empty |
| Review README.md | Confirm v7.0 documentation is current | Complete - README is at v7.0 |

### Phase 3: Documentation (User Decision Required)

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Archive temp files | If temp/ exists, archive to `.claude-workspace/archive/development-logs/` | N/A - temp/ does not exist |
| Update deliverables/ | Package UAT artifacts if needed | Optional - directory empty, can populate on next release |

## Findings

### README.md Status
- Current version: v7.0 (up to date)
- Previous memory indicated v4.0, but this was outdated - README has been updated

### Temp Directory Status
- Path checked: `/Users/roland/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/code/mcp_memory/temp/`
- Result: Directory does not exist (already cleaned or never created at this path)

### Deliverables Directory Status
- Path: `.claude-workspace/deliverables/`
- Result: Exists but empty - ready for future UAT packages

### Cleanup Summary (2026-01-03)
- Removed `__pycache__` directories from tests and benchmarks (preserved .venv caches)
- Removed 3 `.pytest_cache` directories
- Removed 1 `.coverage` file

---

## Completion Criteria

- [x] All `__pycache__` directories cleaned
- [x] All `.pytest_cache` directories cleaned
- [x] All `.coverage` files cleaned
- [x] Temp file status verified and documented
- [x] Deliverables directory status verified

## Notes

This plan was auto-generated based on remaining items from the v7 Quality Benchmark Suite implementation (task-20260101-v7).
